As public transit fleets evaluate bus electrification to meet zero-emission goals, costly and lengthy construction timelines can hamper deployment. To meet this need, <a href=""https://amplypower.com/?utm_source=pr&amp;utm_medium=prnewswire&amp;utm_campaign=duke_energy"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">AMPLY Power</a> is working with <a href=""https://sustainablesolutions-duke-energy-com-staging.go-vip.net/solutions/?utm_source=pr&amp;utm_medium=prnewswire&amp;utm_campaign=amply_power"">Duke Energy </a><a href=""https://sustainablesolutions-duke-energy-com-staging.go-vip.net/solutions/?utm_source=pr&amp;utm_medium=prnewswire&amp;utm_campaign=amply_power"">Sustainable Solutions</a> to expand fleet electrification offerings, including the first commercially available combination solar canopy and overhead electric vehicle charging solution covered by a power purchase agreement (PPA) leasing and financing model. The field-tested solution, enabled by the patent-pending Pantograph In-Depot Equipment (PIDE) Canopy Mount, allows fleets to reduce the cost of EV charging while leveraging renewable electricity.

AMPLY CEO Vic Shao is introducing the new solution at Greenbiz’ <a href=""https://events.greenbiz.com/events/verge-electrify/online/2021"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">VERGE Electrify</a> virtual conference today, Wednesday, May 26, 2021, at 11:30 am PT as a part of the innovation showcase. Companies that have collaborated on this offering will present in a panel afterwards at the AMPLY virtual booth.

“Solar PPAs and managed charging can help fleet operators double-down on the cost savings that electric vehicles already deliver compared to diesel. Solar power generation is usually an afterthought, and we developed this unique solution after witnessing transit agencies struggling with the costs associated with developing an overhead charging system,” said Vic Shao, CEO of AMPLY Power. “Unlike diesel prices, electricity rate can fluctuate wildly throughout the day, sometimes by as much as 400%, making it impossible to ‘time the market’ and potentially wiping out EV savings. By combining overhead charging with a fixed rate of power, we are helping fleets bring predictability to their budgets and reduce their exposure to high rates.”

Once built and installed in a depot, AMPLY Power and Duke Energy Sustainable Solutions will manage the solar charging and maintenance operations via a PPA, a common financing model used in the commercial solar industry. The solar and charging agreements extend 20 to 25 years and offer a fixed rate of power with no upfront capital expenditures.

“Our collaboration with AMPLY goes beyond solar carports with overhead chargers,” explained Dan Alcombright, Managing Director of Growth Implementation at Duke Energy Sustainable Solutions. “We are committed to supporting fleets in reaching their zero-emission targets, while incorporating more resiliency into their operations and reducing their energy costs for charging.”

The full offering includes all aspects of EV charging infrastructure and solar carports, as well as AMPLY’s Charging-as-a-Service support model. AMPLY simplifies the transition to EVs for fleets by assuming end-to-end responsibility for all vehicle charging needs, from cloud-based system design to installing local site controllers. The company’s proprietary back-end software, OMEGA™, and operational methods enable fleets to drive utility costs down by optimizing EV charging and other energy use at both public and private depots. This process maximizes existing electrical capacity to avoid costly utility service upgrades when possible.

<a href=""https://www.teichert.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Teichert</a>, a civil and structural engineering and construction firm founded in 1887 (one of the oldest in California), is the design builder of the PIDE canopy mount and solar carports. Customized canopies are designed to complement a variety of parking configurations within a depot and across multiple sites.  This maximizes the available parking area while minimizing the impact on site functionality.

The PIDE-enabled system was field-tested during a demonstration in Lancaster, California in March of this year. The demonstration used a <a href=""https://en.byd.com/bus/30-electric-transit-bus/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">BYD K9 transit bus</a>, equipped with overhead charging, and a <a href=""https://www.schunk-group.com/transit-systems/en/innovations/smart-charging"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Schunk Transit Systems</a> SLS 301 pantograph DC fast charger.

AMPLY Power has partnered with several transit agencies to support their transition to electric, including <a href=""https://www.amplypower.com/amply-power-saves-up-to-40-on-energy-costs-for-tri-delta-transit-electric-buses/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Tri Delta Transit</a>, <a href=""https://www.amplypower.com/soltrans-turns-to-amply-power-to-simplify-electric-bus-fleet-charging/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Solano County Transit</a>, and the <a href=""https://www.amplypower.com/anaheim-transportation-network-breaks-ground-on-a-46-all-battery-electric-solar-charging-facility/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Anaheim Transportation Network</a>. AMPLY recently joined forces with the California Mobility Center to accelerate the transition to e-mobility throughout California and was also named on the 2021 Global Cleantech 100 list for the second year in a row.

<strong> </strong>The PIDE Mount and overhead charging solar canopy are available today.

<h6>18.5-acre facility to generate up to a quarter of university’s electricity, create millions of dollars in savings</h6>
[/fusion_text][fusion_separator style_type=""single solid"" hide_on_mobile=""small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility"" class="""" id="""" sep_color="""" top_margin=""10"" bottom_margin=""30"" border_size="""" icon="""" icon_circle="""" icon_circle_color="""" width="""" alignment=""center"" /][fusion_text]

Cal Poly’s new solar farm, the university’s first major energy project since announcing a goal of climate neutrality, was dedicated at a Wednesday, Jan. 24, ceremony at the site.

The 18.5-acre solar farm will generate more than 11 million kWh per year — enough to power more than 1,000 homes, or about 25 percent of Cal Poly’s total needs — and includes more than 16,000 individual solar panels with a capacity of 4.5 megawatts (AC).

In addition to the environmental benefits, the energy it produces will provide direct savings of about $10 million on Cal Poly’s utility bills over 20 years and will create “Learn by Doing” opportunities for students.

Cal Poly partnered with San Luis Obispo-based REC Solar (which was founded by Cal Poly graduates) to design, construct and maintain the solar facility. <span class=""s1"">REC Solar is a Duke Energy-owned company and leading provider </span>of solar solutions for colleges, universities and school districts with more than 100 completed solar projects for schools that together generate over 30 megawatts. REC Solar also develops solar curriculum and other means of academic enrichment for school clients.

The Cal Poly project uses single-axis tracking technology to follow the sun across the sky, producing nearly a third more energy than a stationary system. It was financed by REC Solar via a power purchase agreement (PPA) <span class=""s1"">with Duke Energy Renewables, </span>which allows Cal Poly to purchase energy at a lower rate, without paying any upfront costs for the system construction and maintenance.

The solar farm was designed to maximize academic applications for both students and faculty by creating a solar engineering and microgrid laboratory in the Electrical Engineering building for students to conduct experiments with solar technology in a hands-on environment. A wide variety of solar farm performance data will be continuously measured and made available through a web-based dashboard to aid in solar technology research.

In addition, Cal Poly’s Animal Science program will use the site to research vegetation management practices for utility scale solar farms by grazing the site with its sheep herd.

“We applaud Cal Poly’s creativity in leveraging the system to inspire research in sustainability for years to come. REC Solar is privileged to be a part of the university’s sustainability journey,” said REC Solar CEO Matt Walz.

REC Solar is partnering with the university to provide funds for student and faculty involvement; help develop curriculum that meets Cal Poly’s sustainability learning objectives and educates future renewable energy professionals; and collaborate on applied research. The curriculum will integrate solar photovoltaic (PV) fundamentals into a variety of science and engineering courses and create new courses for renewable energy system design.

“This is a huge step toward our goal of climate neutrality, and we are very excited about using this new facility to support students’ hands-on learning,” said Dennis Elliot, the university’s director of energy, utilities and sustainability.

California’s Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 set groundbreaking goals to cut the state’s greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, and 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. The 23-campus California State University system, including Cal Poly, chose to go beyond state mandates in its 2014 Sustainability Policy, aiming to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2040 — 10 years ahead of the state goal.

For Earth Day 2016, university President Jeffrey D. Armstrong made Cal Poly a Charter Signatory to the Climate Leadership Commitment, establishing a goal to implement clean-energy plans and achieve a net-zero energy status through energy efficiency and renewable energy by 2050. The efforts also include LEED certified energy-efficient campus buildings, Cal Poly currently has seven LEED-certified projects that represent nearly a third of the campus’ 6 million square feet of building space.

Cal Poly will break ground this summer on a solar farm that will generate renewable energy, create Learn by Doing opportunities for students and save the university millions of dollars.

The facility, to be erected adjacent to Highway 1 on the western side of the Cal Poly campus, will be financed, designed, constructed and maintained by REC Solar, one of the nation’s largest solar providers. REC Solar, headquartered in San Luis Obispo, was founded by Cal Poly graduates in 1997.

The 18.5-acre solar farm is slated for completion in winter 2017. It will include more than 16,000 individual solar panels with a capacity of 4.5 megawatts (AC) and will generate more than 11 million kWh per year — enough to power more than 1,000 homes, or about 25 percent of Cal Poly’s total needs.

The solar farm will use single-axis tracking technology to follow the sun across the sky, producing approximately 30 percent more energy than a stationary system.

In addition to the environmental benefits, the energy produced by the solar farm will result in direct savings on Cal Poly’s utility bills totaling about $17 million over 20 years. The solar farm is being financed by REC Solar via a power purchase agreement (or PPA), which allows Cal Poly to purchase energy at a lower rate, without paying any upfront costs for the system construction and maintenance.

“This is the first major energy project Cal Poly has undertaken since we committed to achieving climate neutrality,” said Dennis Elliot, the university’s director of energy, utilities and sustainability. “This is a huge step toward our goal of climate neutrality, and we are very excited about using this new facility to support student hands-on Learn by Doing.”

The solar farm is being designed to maximize academic applications for both students and faculty.

<h6>SOMO Village Mixed-Use Development Announces Landmark 1 MW Solar-Plus-Energy Storage Installation</h6>
[/fusion_text][fusion_separator style_type=""single solid"" hide_on_mobile=""small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility"" class="""" id="""" sep_color="""" top_margin=""10"" bottom_margin=""30"" border_size="""" icon="""" icon_circle="""" icon_circle_color="""" width="""" alignment=""center"" /][fusion_text]

<a href=""http://www.greencharge.net/"">Green Charge</a> and REC Solar today announced plans to build the largest commercial solar-plus-energy storage project in Sonoma County.

Green Charge’s one megawatt (MW) commercial energy storage system paired with REC Solar’s solar system will be installed at SOMO Village in Rohnert Park, Calif. The combined solar-plus-storage system is expected to deliver more than $160,000 savings to SOMO Village in the first year and more than $1.8 million over the first 10 years of operations.

SOMO Village is a mixed-use development with approximately 600,000 sf of commercial space with 50 businesses employing around 1,000 people. The property consumes nearly six MW of energy annually and redevelopment plans include a host of shops, apartments, homes and neighborhoods.  SOMO Village currently has existing solar systems onsite, which are now expanded to bring the total to 16,000 solar panels at the 200-acre campus, creating Sonoma County’s largest solar-plus-storage project.

SOMO Village was the first development in North America to be named a “One Planet Community” by Bioregional, an organization that works with partners to champion a better, more sustainable way to live, work and do business. Bioregional’s One Planet Living framework uses ecological and carbon footprinting as its primary guiding principles. The principles are based on ten criteria, including zero carbon emissions.

“SOMO Village is a leader in renewable energy adoption,” said Alan Russo, senior vice president of sales and marketing at REC Solar. “We are proud to be their energy partner and to work alongside the Green Charge team to maximize the impact of their solar investment.”

Commercial and industrial organizations such as SOMO Village are increasingly adding energy storage to decrease their dependence on a centralized electrical grid and to augment the economic benefits of their solar systems. Rocky Mountain Institute found that the increase in solar photovoltaic (PV) self-consumption due to the addition of energy storage has a value of about $25 per kilowatt-year and that demand charge reduction could be worth as much as $200 per kilowatt-year. With solar-plus-storage, businesses can consume all the solar power they produce rather than feeding it back to the grid. This lowers demand charges, offsets energy purchases and reduces utility bills.

“Solar PV has long been seen as an environmentally responsible energy choice, but many companies now deploy solar with energy storage because it is also a smart business choice,” said Vic Shao, CEO of Green Charge. “With a combined solar and storage system, the potential savings and return on investment can be much greater than each can provide on a standalone basis.”

On Wednesday, November 16, at 10:00 a.m. PT, Green Charge and REC Solar will host a free webinar entitled “Commercial Solar + Storage: A Cornucopia of Savings featuring Codding Enterprises.”  Visit <a href=""http://www.greencharge.net/commercial-solar-storage-a-cornucopia-of-savings-green-charge-webinar-111616/"">www.greencharge.net/commercial-solar-storage-a-cornucopia-of-savings-green-charge-webinar-111616/</a> to register.

<a href=""http://www.hawaiifoodbank.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">The Hawaii Foodbank</a> and REC Solar today celebrated the installation of a new solar array at the Foodbank’s Oahu warehouse. The 296.7 kilowatt solar system is estimated to save the Hawaii Foodbank about 463,742 kilowatt-hours of energy in the first year, which is equivalent to the purchase of over 102,000 meals, feeding 93 people daily over the course of one year.

“We are proud to have such a large scale solar installation at the Hawaii Foodbank,” said President &amp; CEO Gerald Shintaku. “This new technology will reduce our energy costs significantly and will allow us to serve more hungry families while also contributing to a more sustainable environment on Oahu.”

The Hawaii Foodbank’s new solar system is projected to save the nonprofit about $41,041 in energy costs during the first year of installation and approximately $2.1 million over the next 25 years. The Foodbank’s use of solar energy will also reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 9,841 tons and decrease the amount of water usage for fossil fuel energy production by 2,929,671 megagrams.

“It is an honor to be involved in a project where solar power is being used to offset operational expenses and will ultimately help provide more meals for those in need,” said Alan Russo, Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing at REC Solar. “We are proud of our work with the Hawaii Foodbank and we look forward to continuing our tradition of providing green energy solutions to other local organizations.”

<a href=""https://recsolar.com/"">REC Solar</a>, a leading provider of commercial solar and energy solutions, today announced the appointment of Matt Walz as chief executive officer.

Walz has worked at Duke Energy for 12 years and joins REC Solar after serving on the company’s board of directors. Walz’s appointment is an extension of Duke Energy’s commitment to provide affordable and accessible energy solutions to REC Solar’s commercial customers.

Walz brings to REC Solar leadership experience in renewable energy, retail electric supply and wholesale generation. Building off his tenure as a vice president at the nation’s largest utility, Walz will help REC Solar further integrate with Duke Energy Renewables and create additional strategic partnerships to solve commercial customers’ most pressing energy challenges.

“Our customers want an energy partner that understands the unique needs of both small and large businesses and is able to provide simple, affordable and customized solutions,” said Walz. “As CEO, I am bringing together the nearly two decades of solar experience at REC Solar with Duke Energy’s more than 100 years’ experience serving customers’ energy needs.”

The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) <a href=""https://www.seia.org/research-resources/solar-industry-data"">notes</a> that “challenges remain in providing competitive financing for smaller companies without credit ratings.”

“Together, Duke Energy and REC Solar are providing secure financing options, partnering with best-in-class service and technology providers, and using our energy experience to build the best solution for each customer,” Walz added. “We want to make it easy for customers to save money and generate onsite solar power.”

When Duke Energy acquired its majority interest in REC Solar in 2015, the company committed to invest up to $225 million in commercial solar projects developed through the commercial solar leader and supported by long-term power purchase agreements. This is bridging the gap between customer demand for and access to fast financing, reliable service and comprehensive energy solutions.

“Delivering a simple sales and financing process to commercial energy buyers gives them quick access to smart, high-quality solutions to their complex energy problems,” said Rob Caldwell, an REC board member and president of Duke Energy Renewables and Distributed Energy Technology. “Matt’s leadership experience makes him well qualified to solve these challenges and lead REC Solar into its next phase of growth. REC Solar and Duke Energy Renewables bring unmatched collective expertise to any company seeking to lower energy costs and find multiple services under one provider.”

Under Walz’s leadership, REC Solar is expanding beyond its traditional direct sales model and accelerating its value to customers by creating a network of strategic partnerships with trusted energy companies:
<ol>
 	<li>Channel partner program. REC Solar is creating a one-stop shop to provide easy financing and project support for a broad range of solar partners. The company announced Sungevity as its first partner earlier this year and is actively onboarding dozens more. The program includes competitive financing options for projects ranging between 50KW and 2MW.</li>
</ol>
<ol start=""2"">
 	<li>Enterprise solutions group. REC has a team focused on providing enterprise solar and energy solutions to the Fortune 1000. To address the broader energy needs of these customers, REC Solar has built partnerships with best-in-class energy solutions providers like Green Charge Networks (energy storage) and Phoenix Energy Technologies (energy management software). It also works closely with Duke Energy Renewables. Instead of bundling standardized solutions, the company tailors the right package of high-quality products and services for the unique needs of each business.</li>
</ol>
“REC Solar is focused on growing partnerships and deploying affordable financing to meet the specific needs of commercial customers who want more options, not fewer. We’re a partner that truly understands the business of energy generation,” added Walz.

<h6>Increases Customer Savings in Markets Such as California and Hawaii
With this Agreement, Duke Energy Renewables has Created a Suite of Onsite Energy Solutions for Commercial Customers</h6>

<a href=""https://www.duke-energy.com/renewable-energy"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Duke Energy Renewables</a> is increasing savings for commercial solar customers through an alliance with Green Charge Networks, the country’s largest provider of commercial energy storage for retail, industrial and government customers.

The agreement provides these customers with “solar firming,” a way to smooth the peaks and valleys of a variable energy source. It also saves customers money by offsetting the higher prices of peak demand power.

Green Charge Networks, based in Santa Clara, Calif., will work closely with solar provider REC Solar to market energy storage systems with REC’s solar projects. Initial focus will be on the Southern California and Hawaiian markets.

Duke Energy acquired a <a href=""https://news.duke-energy.com/releases/duke-energy-and-rec-solar-team-to-make-distributed-solar-more-affordable-and-accessible-to-commercial-customers"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">majority interest in REC Solar</a> and energy management company <a href=""https://news.duke-energy.com/releases/duke-energy-acquires-majority-stake-in-energy-management-company-phoenix-energy-technologies"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Phoenix Energy Technologies</a> earlier this year.

“Our goal is to make it easier for customers to combine solar and storage, so they can benefit from high quality, consistent and economical power 24/7” said Greg Wolf, president Duke Energy Renewables and Commercial Portfolio. “In addition, through Phoenix ET, we’ll also have the ability to offer other energy management systems for those customers seeking a complete and integrated energy savings platform.”

REC Solar, based in San Luis Obispo, Calif., serves customers nationwide in the retail, manufacturing, agriculture, technology, government and nonprofit sectors and was ranked by PBN Research as the leading solar company in Hawaii by 2014 revenue.

“Energy storage adds to the list of compelling reasons why businesses should go solar,” said Al Bucknam, CEO, REC Solar. “Commercial customers save money by adding energy storage to reduce their peak demand, which can account for up to 50 percent of their electricity bill.”

With a combination of lithium-ion battery technology and predictive software, Green Charge systems will draw power from the REC Solar system and the grid during off-peak hours, when electricity is inexpensive, and release it during peak hours, when electricity is more expensive.

“Energy storage is the ideal complement to REC Solar’s offering, helping customers get the most out of a sustainable resource, securing their investment through solar firming and lowering energy costs,” said Vic Shao, CEO at Green Charge Networks. “By partnering with the largest electric power holding company in the United States and REC Solar, we add momentum to our domestic expansion plans.”

Both REC Solar and Green Charge Networks provide competitive, customer-friendly financing options. Green Charge offers a financing model that allows customers to reduce energy costs with no capital output. REC Solar offers tailored financing packages, including leases and power purchase agreements, through an efficient and streamlined financing relationship with Duke Energy.

The Green Charge energy storage platform, a scalable, modular system that monitors facility loads on a second-by-second basis, received the 2015 Product of the Year award from Energy Manager Today.

With behind-the-meter solar, energy storage and demand management offerings, Duke Energy has created a compelling platform of onsite energy solutions for commercial customers large and small.

<h6>Heart Hill Vineyard Campus Goes to Net-Zero Energy, Expects to Save Approximately $2M Over 20 Years</h6>
[/fusion_text][fusion_separator style_type=""single solid"" hide_on_mobile=""small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility"" class="""" id="""" sep_color="""" top_margin=""10"" bottom_margin=""30"" border_size="""" icon="""" icon_circle="""" icon_circle_color="""" width="""" alignment=""center"" /][fusion_text]

<a href=""/about/"">REC Solar</a>, a national provider of commercial solar and energy solutions, today announced the interconnection of two solar energy arrays totaling 388 kW at Niner Wine Estates in Paso Robles, Calif. Together, the systems will provide enough clean energy to power 100 percent of Niner’s 46-acre Heart Hill Vineyard, including the tasting room, restaurant and winery operations. Niner will save approximately $2 million over a 20-year period.

Niner Wine Estates, located in the heart of California’s Central Coast wine region, is committed to integrating sustainability into every aspect of their operations. Accordingly, Niner sought to offset 100 percent of their electricity consumption with solar. To meet Niner’s ambitious net-zero goal, REC Solar analyzed Niner’s energy profile to size the roof and ground mounted systems accordingly.

“Sustainability has been important to our business since we started, and solar has been a missing piece for us,” said Andy Niner, president of Niner Wine Estates. “With the price of solar panels at an all-time low and the upcoming expiration of the federal tax credit, now is the right time for Niner to go solar. Best of all, the system pays for itself in approximately five years, which is a familiar timeline for us—it’s how long it takes to cultivate a vine and bottle new wine.”

The solar systems were designed and engineered to meet Niner’s specific needs. REC Solar took advantage of California Net Energy Meter Aggregation to locate Niner’s systems on low-value land and the winery roof, rather than on productive soil. REC also ensured that the systems matched the winery’s aesthetic and integrated quality technology.

“Wineries plan to be in operation for decades and need their investments to stand the test of time,” said Ryan Park, director of business development at REC Solar. “REC drew on its experience working with wineries across California to build a quality system that reliably delivers serious savings for the long haul. We even ‘futureproofed’ the system to continue providing 100 percent of Niner’s energy needs even after an upcoming facility expansion is complete.”

REC Solar is a leading provider of <a href=""https://recsolar.com/agriculture-farms-solar-projects#wineries-solar"">solar energy solutions to wineries</a>. REC Solar’s recent acquisition of Stellar Energy expands the company’s robust wine portfolio. REC now counts more than 30 winery customers, including Rombauer Vineyards, St. Supery Estate Vineyards &amp; Winery, J&amp;L Wines and Shale Oak Winery. Backed by Duke Energy, one of the largest energy companies in the world, REC Solar provides tailored financing packages and construction services to help wineries go solar with no money down and no business disruptions.

In total, these systems comprise nearly 7 MW of solar generation capacity across rooftops, carports and ground-mounted arrays.

""The VA has gone above and beyond to meet their sustainability goals by developing a strong portfolio of renewable energy projects,” said John Handy, Federal Business Development Manager at REC Solar. “Our goal is to ensure smooth construction of solar systems, quickly and affordably, so the VA can maintain focus on their core mission of veteran care without interruption.”

REC Solar will serve as the engineering, procurement and solar system contractor for these systems, while HICAPS acts as the prime general contractor responsible for site civil construction and overall management and implementation of the projects. These arrays bring REC Solar’s total installations with the Department of Veteran’s Affairs up to 21, and HICAPS’ installed projects up to $25 million.

The 5 MW system at the VA Las Vegas Medical Center will span carport and ground-mount structures, including a 200 kW structure that provides shade for water tanks. HICAPS and REC Solar will work with the VA to ensure that no parking spaces are blocked during the construction process, which is expected to be completed in December 2015.

For the Salem VA Medical Center, HICAPS and REC Solar installed 1.8 MW of solar capacity. After successful completion of a 1.6 MW array in 2013, the U.S. Department of Veteran’s Affairs selected HICAPS and REC Solar to construct an additional 200 kW system. By utilizing a ballasted mounting system that avoids ground penetrations, the companies were able to locate the system on a brownfield next to the medical center.

“Over the past several years, we’ve partnered with REC Solar to design high-quality, custom systems on facilities with challenging site characteristics, including the Salem VA Medical Center and Las Vegas VA Medical Centers,” said Chris Roth, HICAPS’ Project Manager. “We’re proud to bring the VA Medical Centers a cost-effective way to reduce expenses and improve their environmental impact.”

The U.S. Department of Veteran’s Affairs is under an executive order to implement sustainable programs that minimize the environmental impact of operations. Solar energy systems have been a large component of the VA’s strategy to meet this executive order.[/fusion_text][fusion_text]

<h6>REC Solar Completes Six New Solar Projects for Dole Plantation and W.M. Keck Observatory</h6>
[/fusion_text][fusion_separator style_type=""single solid"" hide_on_mobile=""small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility"" class="""" id="""" sep_color="""" top_margin=""10"" bottom_margin=""30"" border_size="""" icon="""" icon_circle="""" icon_circle_color="""" width="""" alignment=""center"" /][fusion_text]

REC Solar, a national leader in commercial solar system design and installation, today announced growing momentum across the state of Hawaii, with the completion of six solar energy systems for Hawaii’s historic Dole Plantation and W.M. Keck Observatory. REC Solar has a total of 19 megawatts of projects in Hawaii completed or under construction in 2014, with more than 27 megawatts of solar installations since 2008.

REC Solar was selected to design and install four ground-mount systems at the Dole Plantation, located on Oahu, Hawaii. Dole Plantation is one of Oahu’s most popular visitor attractions and welcomes more than one million visitors a year.

“We needed a contractor that would minimize the impact on daily operations at Dole Plantation during construction. REC Solar made the installation process easy and efficient by working openly with our team,” said Michael Moon, Director of Operations for Dole Plantation. “Now, we use the Hawaii sun to not only support agricultural activities, but also to help us reduce our impact on the planet. It also provides us an historical connection by harnessing the sun to harvest a new crop: renewable energy!”

REC Solar also installed two solar roof-mount projects at the Headquarters and Visiting Scientist Quarters of the W.M. Keck Observatory, located in Kamuela, Hawaii. The solar electric systems are lowering the facility’s operational costs to support the world’s two largest optical and infrared telescopes, the ten-meter Keck I and Keck II.

“Keck Observatory built and operates the world’s largest and most scientifically-productive telescopes, and we have a proven track record of implementing world-class systems,” said Steve Jefferson, Communications Officer for W. M. Keck Observatory. “We looked at our solar energy system in the same way. REC Solar met our high quality standards in both the design and the installation of our system. We are proud of our efforts to reduce our impact on the petroleum-based energy grid and get a real kick knowing we are harnessing the power of a star to view other stars and the cosmos that spawned them.”

Hawaii is a rapidly growing solar market that benefits from abundant sunshine and a renewable mandate to obtain 40 percent of its power from local renewable generation by 2030. REC Solar has already established itself as a leader in Hawaii’s burgeoning solar industry with the completion of a 1.2 megawatt utility-scale project with Kauai Island Utility Cooperative (KIUC). In June 2014, REC Solar began construction of an additional 14.53 megawatts DC solar project for KIUC Anahola, a utility system that will be the largest PV system in Hawaii upon completion.

“REC Solar is quickly expanding to provide high-quality systems and service to more and more businesses in Hawaii,” said Drew Bradley, Hawaii Sales Manager in Hawaii for REC Solar. “By supporting our customers every step of the way, from feasibility studies to post-construction maintenance, we make going solar not just profitable but also painless.”

REC Solar, a national leader in commercial solar electric system design and installation, today announced that it has commenced construction on a 12 MW AC (14.53 MW DC) solar array for Hawaiian utility Kaua‘i Island Utility Cooperative (KIUC). With 57,624 panels, the utility solar project will be one of Hawaii’s largest systems upon completion and REC Solar’s largest project to date.

The 60-acre solar PV system will be located in Anahola on the northeast side of the island of Kaua‘i. Upon completion in 2015, it will generate five percent of Kaua‘i’s annual energy needs, or enough electricity to power 4,000 homes. A six MW lithium-ion battery system will be installed alongside the array to store energy when the sun is shining and distribute it when clouds reduce the system’s output.

REC Solar has established itself as a leading solar company in Hawaii, with almost 20 MW of utility and commercial-scale projects complete or underway. The Anahola system is the second project that REC Solar has developed with KIUC, following a 1.2 MW array in Kapa‘a. Other commercial systems include wastewater treatment centers, schools and major retailers on the Hawaiian Islands.

“Over many years of experience developing and installing commercial projects in Hawaii, we’ve gained expertise managing approval and development cycles with Hawaiian partners and organizations,” said Drew Bradley, Hawaii Regional Manager at REC Solar. “Our customers count on us through every step of the installation process, from efficiently navigating state regulations to working with the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands. Delays can be costly, so our collaborative process is designed to help customers like KIUC cut through the red tape and expedite construction.”

A groundbreaking event on June 26, 2014 marked the beginning of construction. Hawaii Lt. Gov. Shan Tsutsui, KIUC president and CEO David Bissell and REC Solar’s Drew Bradley participated in the ceremony, which included a traditional Hawaiian blessing.

KIUC’s Bissell commented, “REC Solar brings experience and professionalism to this project. We’ve been pleased by the team’s efforts at working collaboratively with us and with the community that will host it.”

IKEA, the world’s leading home furnishings retailer, today announced it had completed the installation of South Florida’s largest solar array, which will be plugged-in officially atop the future Miami-Dade IKEA store opening this summer in Sweetwater, FL. Combined with rooftop arrays in Orlando, Tampa and Sunrise, this fourth solar project will keep IKEA as the state’s largest non-utility solar owner.

The 178,000-square-foot solar array consists of a 1,178-kW system, built with 4,620 panels, and will produce approximately 1,738,876 kWh of electricity annually for the store, the equivalent of reducing 1,227 tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) – equal to the emissions of 256 cars or providing electricity for 169 homes yearly (calculating clean energy equivalents at <a href=""http://www.epa.gov/cleanenergy/energy-resources/calculator.html"">www.epa.gov/cleanenergy/energy-resources/calculator.html</a>). For the development, design and installation of the Miami-Dade store’s customized solar power system, IKEA contracted with REC Solar, a national leader in solar electric system design and installation with more than 350 systems built across the U.S.

This installation will represent the 40th solar project for IKEA in the U.S, contributing to the IKEA solar presence atop nearly 90% of its U.S. locations, and a total generation of 38 MW. IKEA owns and operates each of its solar PV energy systems atop its buildings – as opposed to a solar lease or <a href=""https://recsolar.com/solar-financing-ppa/"">PPA (power purchase agreement)</a> – and globally has allocated $1.8 billion to invest in renewable energy through 2015. This investment reinforces the long-term commitment of IKEA to sustainability and confidence in photovoltaic (PV) technology. Consistent with the company’s goal of being energy independent by 2020, IKEA has installed more than 550,000 solar panels on buildings across the world and owns/operates approximately 157 wind turbines in Europe and Canada, with 49 more being built in the U.S.

“Completing this solar array is an exciting milestone as we prepare to open IKEA Miami this summer,” said Selwyn Crittendon, IKEA Miami store manager. “IKEA strives to create a sustainable life for communities where we operate, so we are proud this new store will generate solar power while offering our unique selection of affordable home furnishings.”

IKEA, drawing from its Swedish heritage and respect of nature, believes it can be a good business while doing good business and aims to minimize impacts on the environment. Globally, IKEA evaluates locations regularly for conservation opportunities, integrates innovative materials into product design, works to maintain sustainable resources, and flat-packs goods for efficient distribution. Specific U.S. sustainable efforts include: recycling waste material; incorporating energy-efficient HVAC and lighting systems, recycled construction materials, skylights in warehouse areas, and water-conserving restrooms. Operationally, IKEA eliminate plastic bags from the check-out process, phased-out the sale of incandescent bulbs, facilitates recycling of customers’ compact fluorescent bulbs, and by 2016 will sell only L.E.D. IKEA also has installed EV charging stations at 13 stores, with plans for more locations.

The 416,000 square-foot future IKEA Miami, with 1,500 parking spaces, is being built on 14.6 acres adjacent to the Dolphin Mall, at the intersection of the Dolphin Expressway (SR 836) and Florida’s Turnpike, in the City of Sweetwater. Until IKEA Miami opens as the 2nd IKEA store in South Florida and fourth in the state, customers can shop at Broward County’s IKEA Sunrise.

Since its 1943 founding in Sweden, IKEA has offered home furnishings of good design and function, at low prices so the majority of people can afford them. There are currently more than 350 IKEA stores in 44 countries, including 38 in the U.S. IKEA incorporates sustainability into day-to-day business and supports initiatives that benefit children and the environment.

Like many who find themselves in corporate energy management roles, Craig D'Arcy didn't go to college for energy. He studied finance, a career that helped support a family and lifestyle near his hometown of Atlanta, Ga.

&nbsp;

It was Craig's desire to cut energy spend and find straightforward answers to complex problems that led him to move into energy management at The Home Depot. Every day he helps the world's largest home improvement retailer – which operates more than 2,200 stores and employs over 400,000 people – find creative ways to lower the overall net rate it pays for energy. And measurably cut emissions in the process.

&nbsp;

Craig and his team inspire us by stepping up to help reduce store emissions by 50%.

&nbsp;

""My daughter likes to tell people that Daddy controls the lights. It feels great to walk in with the family and know that I'm contributing to what's going on at the store … and know our investments in renewables are creating savings for a purpose.""

For Jana Ganion, walking through an ancient redwood forest is more than a hike through very tall trees. It's an exploration of the power of connectedness and enduring adaptability.

&nbsp;

Jana inspires us for her efforts to help the Blue Lake Rancheria – a federally recognized native American tribe located in far northwestern California – adapt to weather emergencies and financial challenges by adopting the latest renewables and microgrid technologies.

Through a series of Climate Smart Resiliency initiatives, tribal leaders and Jana are choosing sustainability first to address energy, food sovereignty, water, communications, and information technology (IT). For Jana, their Climate Smart programs start with solar energy generation and battery backup. The technologies will also help the tribe combat climate change and hit its goal to be 100% emissions free by 2030.

&nbsp;

""The climate crisis is the issue of our time. When I get back out into the forest, I think about this broader timeline. It gives me a sense of optimism and confidence that we can get there.""

The next day, the United States entered World War II. Two days later, Kaho`olawe, the smallest of the eight islands that make up the state of Hawai`i and a sacred site for Native Hawaiians for more than 1,000 years, became a bombing test range for the U.S. military.

Over the next 50 years, Kaho`olawe was used for military training and surface explosions, some as large as 500 tons of conventional TNT, meant to simulate the effects of a nuclear blast. After decades of public protests, the entire island was put on the National Register of Historic Places in 1981 and the bombings finally stopped in 1990. In 1993, the island was designated a cultural reserve, then officially conveyed back to the state of Hawai`i from the U.S. military a year later. Today, the Kaho`olawe Island Reserve Commission (KIRC) is tasked with restoring the reserve, comprised of roughly 45 square miles of land and neighboring waters out to 2 miles.

""My goal is to heal the land and create a teaching opportunity for generations,"" says KIRC's executive director the past 12 years, Honolulu native Michael (Mike) K. Naho`opi`i.

Mike is an electrical engineer, U.S. military veteran, U.S. Navy nuclear submarine officer and former naval commander of Kaho`olawe. He is also trained in traditional Hawaiian hula and is a museum-quality lauhala weavings artist. Some of his woven hats were exhibited at the Smithsonian in Washington, D.C. Experienced corporate administrator, proud father, sailor, swimmer, handyman and more, Mike says that all of his experiences come together when he teaches future generations how to live sustainably and meld the past into the future. To Mike, the melding is as important as healing Kaho`olawe itself.

""Bridging the gap between science and cultural practitioners who often say the same thing just in different languages takes a lot of effort. I won't turn away from either side of the coin, culture or science. Each supports the other. I want to create something that has traditional cultural values meshed with modern scientific technologies.""

Addressing each day of KIRC's polyglot of natural and man-made problems is what Mike says he has been ""training for his entire life.""

""As a kid, I was always doing science fairs and creating my own research projects. When I learned about research scientists, that's what I wanted to be.""

While attending high school at the renowned <a href=""https://www.ksbe.edu/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Kamehameha Schools</a>, Mike studied biology under Dr. Charles Burrows, an early leader in the burgeoning environmental movement. ""Doc Burrows"" taught that ""all living things, even non-living, are ohana, your relative."" Mike was also inspired by Doc Burrows' High School Hikers program, a youth program that influenced many to enter conservation. Mike said those hikes ignited his lifelong passion for natural science and ancient Hawaiian philosophy and culture.

When Mike enrolled in the U.S. Naval Academy though, he learned that the Navy did not educate scientists. It trained engineers. Electrical engineering degree in hand, Mike joined the Navy's nuclear power program, first working at a nuclear power plant and then on submarines. Mike recalls chasing Soviet Union submarines toward the end of the Cold War as ""very exciting.""

At the end of his naval career, Mike spent a tour of duty on Kaho`olawe, including being the last on-island naval commander. He then left the Navy to help manage the Navy's 10-year cleanup of Kaho`olawe and work in the private sector starting up Native Hawaiian defense contracting companies before returning to Kaho`olawe as KIRC's Executive Director in 2008.

Over the years, Mike has worked with thousands of scientists, archaeologists, construction and explosives experts and volunteers on Kaho`olawe on a variety of projects. That includes the removal of more than a million pounds of unexploded ordnance and weapon fragments during the Navy Clearance project. Staff and volunteers have struggled with lack of fresh water to drink and battling invasive species, including herds of wild goats. Everything from food to fresh water to barrels of oil (the only means of powering island operations prior to the installation of a PV energy and battery storage system in 2018), must be brought in by hand.

[caption id=""attachment_8407"" align=""alignnone"" width=""1000""]<img class=""size-full wp-image-8407"" src=""https://sustainablesolutions-duke-energy-com-staging.go-vip.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/customerheroes_kahoolawe_coastline_sm.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1000"" height=""564"" /> <em>The shoreline of Kaho`olawe, the smallest of the eight primary islands that comprise the State of Hawai`i.

<blockquote class=""alignright""><em><span class=""pullquote"">""If we can show restoration is possible on a landscape as damaged and abused as Kaho`olawe, people will know you can do it anywhere.""</span></em></blockquote>
""One of our long-term goals is to understand we are only the caretakers of the island. Eventually we want people to live on the island (which is currently uninhabited) but not be dependent on outside supplies. Being on our own and having a solar-powered microgrid requires less to bring in by boat. When you load the boat and unload on the shore, and struggle with increasingly choppy seas due to climate change, you realize how important sustainable and renewable resources can be.""

It is crucial to KIRC's mission, says Mike, to teach future generations to learn how to live sustainably so they too can revive native, ancient Hawaiian cultural practices and traditions in their own communities.

""The end result of restoration is not our sole focus. We want to teach. On Kaho`olawe, largely through our volunteer program, the next generation learns about restoration. They learn what makes us self-sustainable and maybe they can be inspired to become more self-sustaining themselves.""

""If they learn that here, they can do it in their own communities. We've really become more of a training area to discover and refine what is possible. Volunteering on Kaho`olawe is an experience that can instill hope and help individuals to see that they can do more in their home communities. If we can show restoration is possible on a landscape as damaged and abused as Kaho`olawe, you know you can do it anywhere.""",,,,,,,,,,

Change is hard.""","A discarded aluminum can, tossed under a flower at the edge of a dirt road.

For Rebecca Navarro, long bike rides with her dad, picking up roadside trash and carrying it in bags balanced on handlebars, is the formative memory that has lingered throughout her career. As a child thriving in rural Connecticut – in ""the part close to New York City without the glamour and lots of cows"" – she learned for the first time that cans are recyclable. She also learned redemption centers paid money for them.

In typical public service fashion, Rebecca donated those coins to charity.

""My dad showed me that service to the Earth is non-negotiable. We owe everything to the natural world. To protect it, we must understand relationships and what impact each of our actions has on the broader environment. Most of our students have never physically experienced or seen the impact of their actions.""

<blockquote class=""alignright""><span class=""pullquote"">""I don't have the luxury of only solving a problem by looking at it with one lens. Each person's feedback is weighed against all the other truths to find an outcome that does the most good for the most people.""</span></blockquote>
Today, relationships and actions are integral to nearly everything Rebecca does as sustainability program manager for one of the U.S.'s top K-12 public school districts, Palo Alto Unified School District (PAUSD). Based in the heart of California's Silicon Valley and Venture Capital Row, Rebecca manages environmental health, clean energy, transportation and quite a bit of education for PAUSD's 17 schools and more than 12,000 students each year. It is a job that Rebecca says is rarely straightforward and frequently contentious.

""Sustainability is always pushing the envelope on people's discomfort. Change is hard. Yet a sustainable journey should not be joyless. When you help and are successful, that's where we make meaningful change.""

Energy, for example, is a tricky thing, says Rebecca. Electricity is not tangible. Unlike watching ice melt, it is hard to see what renewable energy can be replacing.

What people can see is buildings. Landscaping. The way things have been for years.

In the case of PAUSD, when it became known that the best place to locate solar generation – a keystone component of the district's sustainability and city of Palo Alto's climate action plans – was to build highly desired solar parking shade structures in front of a beloved high school, a landmark about to celebrate its centennial, tensions built quickly.

&nbsp;

""I don't have the luxury of only solving a problem by looking at it with one lens. Each person's feedback is weighed against all the other truths to find an outcome that does the most good for the most people.""

The process was initially heated – and political. The solution became collaborative – and lasting.

Working closely with a pivotal community leader who had once been the solar project's biggest detractor, Rebecca and community teams worked together to successfully find and relocate the 100-kW solar array to another school location. From those rough beginnings, the two leaders have since worked together to accelerate other solar installations across six school campuses.

""Having authentic relationships is as important – or even more so – as doing the work. The more you can do now that is genuine in relationships, the more likely that when you get to the other side of a big, contentious project, you will still be on the same team at the end of it.""

Leading by example is also crucial, says Rebecca.

When she first joined PAUSD in 2005 she taught eighth grade English. Rebecca says that shifting to become the district's energy manager was more of a calling than a job. A self-described ""one-woman-energy-conservation-show"" meant lots of walking. For years, visiting hundreds of classrooms, changing thermostat set points, climbing up and down from roofs, calming angry staff disgruntled by overly sensitive lighting controls, she has become a highly visible face of calm answers and changes that frequently push the limits of people's comfort zones.

[caption id=""attachment_8343"" align=""alignnone"" width=""1024""]<img class=""size-full wp-image-8343"" src=""https://sustainablesolutions-duke-energy-com-staging.go-vip.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/customer-heroes_pausd_navarro-family_03.png"" alt="""" width=""1024"" height=""684"" /> <em>Rebecca, husband Sergio and their three children live large outdoors as one of the most important ways to be as close to zero waste as possible.</em>[/caption]

""People are smart, and even if you lead by example or frame change as nonjudgmental, people will feel what they want to feel and that's absolutely OK.""

At home, she lives with her husband, Sergio, and three children, all within an 800-square-foot house. To literally minimize their carbon footprint, they remodeled rather than rebuild larger to take advantage of the smaller space and the great California climate. Rebecca says her family has also gone through their own huge culture shift to achieve as close to zero waste as possible. Today, the entire household produces only a gallon of trash every six months. Everything else is reused, recycled, or composted.

In the end, Rebecca's ultimate wish is that her efforts help her own children as well as future generations make wise decisions – and find some joy doing it along the way.

""What is fun is meeting students where they are. There is a lot of learning underway and to see that spark ignite with students, to see them get out of their routine and into new ways, to watch them learn something new for the first time. That's why I do this. I'm confident students have what they need to grow up to be good stewards of the natural world.""

That's what's important. If you've always had a seat, you take it for granted.""","From the time she was a little girl, Megan Jacobsen has only wanted one career: to work in agriculture.
<blockquote class=""alignright""><em><span class=""pullquote"">""I have a huge passion for farming. I also have a passion for sustainability, though it's no longer something special. Sustainability is integral to everything we do.""</span></em></blockquote>
Growing up and working on family farms in California's central valley heartland, Megan was inspired by generations of hands-on farmers and strong female leaders, including her mother, the first female president of the Fresno Farm Bureau. From the time she joined the Future Farmers of America as a teen to choosing to major in Ag Communications at Fresno State to taking on her current leadership role as vice president of sales and marketing for Gills Onions -- a recognized organic and sustainable agriculture industry leader -- Megan has not been afraid to speak her mind. Or get her hands dirty.

""I grew up in a family where we worked the land,"" Megan said. ""We could not be window farmers, farming from the window of a pickup truck. The day you start window farming, you lose connection and relevancy to the land. My grandfather told me: 'If you don't walk the furrows, you don't know what you're talking about.' That advice has shaped my career into what it is today. Staying connected and relevant is key.""

On any given day, Megan can be found walking the fields, facilitating meetings, working one-on-one with customers, talking with colleagues about their needs or analyzing how to improve operations by investing in renewable energy and sustainable supply chains. She works closely with the Gills co-owners and brothers, Steve and David Gill. Megan points to their collective-mission to continue providing high quality products to customers while preserving the fields for future generations -- as the Gills Onions products are grown in an environmentally conscious way, maintaining soil health and promoting ag sustainability.

[caption id=""attachment_8412"" align=""alignnone"" width=""1024""]<img class=""size-full wp-image-8412"" src=""https://sustainablesolutions-duke-energy-com-staging.go-vip.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/duke-energy-renewables_customer-stories_gills-onions_family-photo-1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1024"" height=""707"" /> <em>A young Megan held by her grandfather during the family's grape crop harvest.</em>[/caption]

""To me, sustainability is not just about solar-powered operations and onion waste. From the time each seed goes into the ground until it goes on a truck, we look at how to make it more environmentally friendly and healthy. So, it's a passion. To me, sustainability is a passion for healthy food and healthy soil.""

But being a female millennial in an ""old school"" industry like farming is not easy, Megan says. It can get particularly sticky as she drives new ideas to lower waste, cut emissions, and improve water quality and soil health in a pre-millennial, historically male industry.

""A seat at the table. That's what's important. If you've always had a seat, you take it for granted. As a woman in this industry, I have to fight for my seat. As a woman, I have to fight for my ideas and fight for people to listen. I have to prove that even after growing up on a farm and within the industry, and 12 years into my professional career, that I know what I'm talking about.. Others don't have to prove that.""
<blockquote class=""alignleft""><em><span class=""pullquote"">""We now know so much more than we did 50 years ago. If we're still farming the same as we did then, we're totally missing the point. Let's farm smarter, more efficiently, better."" </span></em></blockquote>
Among many sustainability initiatives Megan has helped with the purchase and installation of 472 kW of solar energy on the roof of Gills Onions' Oxnard, California-based onion crop processing facility. According to Megan, tapping all the space available on ag-operation rooftops to generate emissions-free energy is both a smart use of resources and a crucial component of good land management.

For more than 10 years, Gills Onions comprehensive sustainability plan has achieved reducing greenhouse gas emissions by installing solar and lowering energy demand, improving air quality by reducing diesel fuels, increasing water efficiency, improving food safety, making soils healthier, and prioritizing quality labor practices.

In addition to lauding her smart business decisions and sustainability leadership, those who work with Megan recognize her as one of the hardest working people they've ever met. That's a rare accolade for her oft-stereotyped millennial generation, she adds.

""Agricultural businesses are undergoing a generational shift. People in my parents' and grandparents' generations are transitioning out. My generation and future generations, we do things very differently. We think differently. The time is now to transition leadership in ag. If we don't transition to next gen, if previous generations don't take future generations under their wing and build them up, we won't be ready.""
<blockquote class=""alignright""><em><span class=""pullquote"">""Whatever you are not changing you are choosing – read that again.""</span></em></blockquote>
A big part of that transition is the shift to fully sustainable ag operations. Megan says that means taking a holistic approach, not just bottom line. She notes that Gills Onions' customers and partners appreciate the company's transparency and intense efforts to green the supply chain, from lowering diesel truck emissions to conserving water. Megan points out that the industry as a whole is being held to a higher standard. Ag is changing.

""I don't blame farmers 50 years ago for their decisions. Today, we know better. If I want change, I must go for it. In personal life, career, or in the world, you need to take responsibility, get up and go be the change. Don't wait for someone else to make the change. That is what I live by.""

7958,"Duke Energy, Firestone Walker Brewing complete one of the largest on-site solar arrays in craft beer industry",,"January 13th, 2021 | Charlotte, NC and Paso Robles, CA for immediate release
<h6>Duke Energy (NYSE: DUK) and Firestone Walker Brewing Company have completed one of the largest on-site solar arrays in the craft beer industry -- a 2.1-megawatt solar array and 281-kilowatt solar carport on 9.7 acres in Paso Robles, Calif.</h6>
The arrays will generate the majority of the brewery’s energy, which is enough to brew and bottle 6 million cases of beer annually.

“REC Solar and Duke Energy Renewables have been solid partners throughout this process. They helped us unlock our vision for ‘beer brewed with sunshine,’ and methodically executed the complex entitlements, engineering and installation of the array. It was as painless a process as we could have hoped,” said David Walker, co-owner of Firestone Walker Brewing Company.

<img class=""wp-image-7911 size-full alignnone"" src=""https://sustainablesolutions-duke-energy-com-staging.go-vip.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rec-commercial-solar_press_firestone-walker-brewing-company.jpg"" alt=""solar array at firestone walker brewing company"" width=""900"" height=""506"" />

The on-site solar, single-axis trackers and carports were made possible through the collaboration of two Duke Energy subsidiaries. REC Solar designed and built the solar project, and Duke Energy Renewables provided Firestone Walker financing through a 25-year power purchase agreement.

“Now more than ever, companies are powering their businesses using renewable energy to ensure sustainability and reduce carbon emissions,” said Chris Fallon, president of Duke Energy Renewables. “Duke Energy is uniquely positioned to offer sustainable solutions that meet the important needs of our customers. We’re proud to work with Firestone Walker to deliver an on-site solar solution and offer financing that will address their needs for decades to come.”

The solar array, which is located adjacent to the brewery in Paso Robles, Calif., features ground-mounted single-axis trackers that maximize solar energy production and is projected to generate 4,055 megawatt-hours (MWh) of electricity in its first year. The second 281-kilowatt array consists of a solar carport spanning 14,000 square feet just south of the brewery, increasing the brewery’s total solar production to 4,570 MWh of electricity generated in its first year. In its entirety, the solar installation is enough to offset 3,231 metric tons of carbon emissions.

Project planning began in late 2016, with groundbreaking in April 2020. In addition to the solar arrays, the project includes utility substation upgrades that will make it easier for other local organizations seeking to go solar to tap into the power of renewable energy.

“We have made a 25-year forward commitment to this project, and we hope that our embrace of solar energy, along with scores of others in our community, will encourage more to do the same,” Walker said.

If so, learn what basis those decisions are made upon and if the most senior decision-makers would consider this type of arrangement. Understand their measurements of a successful project proposal. The answers to these questions will help you to build your business case for Energy Infrastructure as a Service. The process for the first project can easily take 12 months or more once you have answers. After that any additional projects should move more quickly and smoothly.</div>

<div class=""container"">Many ESCO services are performance contracts, where payments are tied to percentages of savings. As a rule, those kinds of contracts lend themselves well to entities with restricted access to capital and very long-term operating commitments like government facilities and public school districts or universities. The type of arrangement Duke Energy One is proposing is not a performance contract, and thus does not come with the same expensive and onerous measurement requirements and potentially argumentative basis for setting payments. The most typical differentiation will be in the ownership of the equipment. Typically, a pure ESCO will not own the equipment, but Duke Energy One will own the equipment with this type of project.</div>

In the right situation this could be theoretically possible. In most cases, the determination of upside sharing and downside costs is often hard to predict for both sides. Ideally you want your agreement to have enough teeth in it to motivate the owner to maximize uptime, but not so onerous that cost of managing the uptime risk is higher than the true value of the uptime. Additionally, be wary of providers that are willing to make uptime guarantees that seem overly ambitious. This might be the first sign of a bad long-term partner.</div>

7976,"Hawaiian Electric, U.S. Navy dedicate West Loch Solar Project",,"November 25, 2019 | Honolulu, HI for immediate release
<h6>Solar array producing the lowest-cost renewable energy in Hawaii to date.</h6>
Hawaiian Electric Company and the Department of the Navy today dedicated the 20-megawatt West Loch Solar Project at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam West Loch Annex. West Loch Solar is producing the lowest-cost renewable energy to date in the state at an estimated 7.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. Hawaiian Electric will own and operate the 80,760-panel solar facility, which was built by REC Solar.

The renewable energy generated by the 102-acre West Loch project will feed into the island’s electric grid and serve all customers on Oahu, including those on base.

The project will save Hawaiian Electric customers at least $109 million over its expected 25-year lifespan, compared with the cost of using oil to generate electricity. It will also reduce the utility’s use of imported oil by 3 million gallons annually.

“West Loch Solar is another shining example of how all in Hawaii can work together to create renewable energy, reducing our need to import fossil fuel,” said Alan Oshima, Hawaiian Electric president and CEO. “We thank the community, the U.S. Navy and the PUC for their shared commitment and kokua.”

In exchange for the land to host the facility, the utility plans to provide electrical infrastructure upgrades to Navy-owned facilities.

“Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam is the key strategic installation for our interests in the Pacific,” said Rear Adm. Robb Chadwick, commander, Navy Region Hawaii and Naval Surface Group Middle Pacific. “We are pleased to be able to increase our base’s energy resiliency while also helping Hawaiian Electric strengthen the state’s electric grid. Innovative, long-term energy solutions like this mutually enhances the Navy’s readiness and the strength of our local communities.”

The Hawaiian Electric Companies are national leaders in the integration of renewable energy on their island grids, using renewables to generate 27 percent of their electricity in 2018. By 2022, there will be more than 4.4 million solar panels delivering energy to our grid.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

<strong>Craig</strong>: Hello everyone. I’m Craig Noxon, VP of Enterprise Sales at REC Solar and today we have a special guest expert. So, Sam Booth. Welcome Sam. Sam is Principle Engineer over here at REC Solar and today we’re going to be responding to a lot of questions that have come up and that we have taken regarding planned power outages and specifically some of the impacts within California and discussing how businesses, cities, schools can prepare for energy uncertainty in the future.

So, Sam, welcome to Solar Tea Time. We appreciate you joining us.

<strong>Sam</strong>: Thanks, Craig.

<strong>Craig</strong>: Great. So, since the power outages and planned power outages in California in late October, as I’ve mentioned, we’ve gotten a lot of questions about how to keep businesses up and running with things like solar and storage, generators, microgrids. Sam, you know, in general people are worried about this and how these shutoffs can impact their business, and, in some cases, people are concerned for their own safety.

So, I have a few questions. I wanted to kind of get the ball rolling and we can kind of discuss this over the next 20 minutes. Sound good?

<strong>Sam</strong>: Sounds great.

<strong>Craig</strong>: So, Sam, maybe you can start us off. So, you’re moving to California. You are well aware of the issues at play. What are some of the implications for businesses for planned power outages and emergency outages?

<strong>Sam</strong>: Yeah, that’s a great question Craig and, you know, definitely our economy is really dependent upon electricity these days and businesses especially are dependent on electricity for a lot of their operations and it’s hard to find a commercial industrial customer that isn’t using electricity and doesn’t view electricity as critical to really getting their business going and getting the job done. I would say that outages – whether they’re planned or unplanned – are always problematic for energy users and are particularly problematic for businesses that are ever-increasingly kind of dependent on that energy.

Historically the electrical grid has been pretty reliable and you see that over the last 50 years of statistics for outages but really this has been changing over the last few years as we see an increasing number of weather events like hurricanes on the east coast, ice storms, and then the public safety power shutoffs we have been having in California and what’s interesting about those is, outages are not only more frequent, but they are much longer than they have been in the past.

So, it was pretty rare previously to have a three-day outage for a large number of customers but that’s really what we’re starting to see in California and, as you mentioned, REC Solar’s offices are in California and we have really felt these outages first hand and we’ve seen it as our staff lives in these communities and we see places like grocery stores that aren’t able to maintain their inventory, agricultural producers that aren’t able to process their harvest because they need that manufacturing equipment. They aren’t able to water their crops because they can’t get the pumps to work to push the water out. Schools are closed and office workers are basically driving around looking for places where they can work and places that have power.

So, if you think about your question of, “What are the implications of that?” there are a lot of lost productivity and a lot of lost revenue from that. You know, on a macro scale, the way most people think about is something like, in my region or my city or my state has a gross domestic product per day and without power a lot of that doesn’t happen. So, the output is reduced.

Sonoma County asked Moody’s actually to look at this. They estimated about a 35-million-dollar economic impact for a 24-hour outage and there was a Stanford professor that looked at this too and estimated about two and a half billion dollars of impact from the October outage.

At a customer level it’s much more specific of, “I lost my process. How long does that – let’s say my manufacturing process. How long does it take to restart and how many orders have I lost and how much inventory have I wasted?”

So, overall, the implications are business-specific but we see that outages are increasing for businesses as they are increasingly dependent on electricity. So, it might be time to start considering options for resiliency.

<strong>Craig</strong>: Yeah, great. So – and what are some of those options for resiliency, Sam? What can people and customers do?

<strong>Sam</strong>: Yeah, just to clarify that, most of the interest we have been getting is around electricity but there is certainly some interest in heating and cooling but most of the impact we have seen is focused on the impact from not having electricity and that can take a few different forms in terms of options. There can be pretty simple things like UPS power supply for a server or a backup diesel generator. Backup generators can be loud. I don’t know if you’ve ever sat next to one, but you can’t hear anything standing next to them. They can be hard to permit. They require regular O&amp;M. They aren’t necessarily that simple.

Other options are solar and storage where the storage can be used to provide that backup power and recharge with the solar PV or a hybrid system that takes the solar and storage and they add a generator or combine power. Kind of the best option for a customer, like any good question, it really depends on what makes the most sense for any customer. Some of those initial options like a UPS or a generator are really designed to be kind of backup power options and maybe operate for a few hours. They are not necessarily a really strong resiliency solution or designed for what we’ve been facing like three-day outages with these power shutoffs.

So, I like to start kind of thinking about solutions by asking a few questions and it starts out with basically trying to figure out why someone is interested in resilience and trying to understand the impact they have faced from outages in the past and how frequent have they been? How long do they have? This kind of helps design the system in terms of maybe how often you need it to operate and how long of an outage it should survive.

I also like to ask about what loads are critical for most businesses. Not every load in the office or in the manufacturing facility is critical. So, what are your critical loads? Where are they on your electrical system? The reason I ask where they are is, sometimes it can be pretty easy to isolate them and just power their critical loads in their outage. Sometimes you may have to pick up some non-critical loads and it’s actually cheaper to build a larger system to do that and then try to ask a few more questions about, “Do you have any existing distributed generation like rooftop solar already or a backup generator already?”

Then try to look at energy bills for a customer and the reason I ask the energy bill questions is because we are looking at electric rates and demand charges and what we’re trying do in a lot of these systems is trying to find out if that business can get any savings from grid connected renewables and storage. So, we like to look for projects that can ideally provide cost savings both when they are grid-connected from the solar produced and maybe from demand charge savings with a battery in addition to the solar and also, how do you use those assets for resiliency, perhaps through a microgrid?

<strong>Craig</strong>: Yeah. So, it’s a good point. You know, interestingly people often – I call it – fight the last war, right? They understand that they had an outage before. So, they may prepare to fix that problem in the future but the challenge with that is that, that exact problem may or may not materialize but building something from a resilient architecture that is able to deal with multiple different kinds of problems and different outages, I mean, I think that’s kind of what you’re talking about, creating something.

And an interesting point you just brought up there which was talking about backup. How do you know if your backup really works or not, right? You only know when you test it and that test that you did on a Tuesday doesn’t necessarily mean it’s going to be ready on a Thursday.

So, I think you are kind of leading to the word “microgrid” that you just talked about. Can you talk a little bit about what is a microgrid? So we define the term and then what should customers be thinking about if they’re looking into a microgrid?

<strong>Sam</strong>: Yeah. So, broadly a microgrid is basically just a group of interconnected loads and distributed generation behind a utility meter and this can happen at sort of a building level or a cluster of buildings or even a campus or a utility feeder. It might help with a few examples.

So it could be something like a data center with backup diesel generators for the building or a manufacturer that has a few buildings on a single feed or the University of California at San Diego or Marine Corps Air Station Miramar that have really large microgrids that cover most of their facilities on a campus level.

REC Solar also worked with Montgomery County in Maryland to design a microgrid to cover some of their critical facilities. So the important thing is that it has some mix of generation and load, and it’s behind a meter. The size can vary and also that it can operate on both grid connected mode and island mode and you need a few kind of components to make that work.

The first thing you need for that system to work – in island mode – is basically a way to isolate the system electrically from the utility. So should the grid go away and you want to operate your microgrid, you need to make sure it is not grid-connected in that case and you need a generation source that can come back online and start everything up and be the voltage and frequency reference. S, the loads and other generation think, basically, that the grid is back, and they can come online and then at a longer time scale, you basically need enough generation and load to match and you need a system to control that load.

If it’s designed properly, kind of like you were saying, it will work on a Tuesday in the afternoon and it’ll work on the weekend and it will work in the winter and work in the summer but it takes some thought and engineering and good analysis to make sure it’s going to work in all those cases and it gets slightly more complicated as you get down into other levels of what load is critical versus what load is essential.

You can also design systems where they’ll power what you deem as critical loads that need to have it every time, 100% of the time. So there might be some loads that you want most of the time but you’re willing to maybe turn them off some of the time or things like a refrigerator where it can survive a few hours of not being on. So, you just really need to run it for 20 minutes every hour but it doesn’t need to be on all the time.

A couple of other kind of interesting considerations to think about are does one want to count on natural gas being there or do they want to use diesel or renewables? Things that either don’t have a fuel supply or have onsite fuel and how much reliability and redundancy do I need and what goals does my organization have as I think about what else I might be able to do with this distributed generation that I’m perhaps putting in for resiliency needs but how can I also help bring me sustainability and cost savings in addition to that?

<strong>Craig</strong>: Yeah and be useful throughout – when you don’t have an outage. I mean, I think that is the important point although there are some other benefits to some of the other technologies that you mentioned as well. You know, just – I wanted to clarify because we get this question sometimes – just to clarify that in a grid outage, a solar-only solution is also going to shut down even though the sun is shining. By law, it is not going to continue to create power for you unless, as you mentioned, you are islanded behind the meter in a microgrid fashion.

So, I just wanted to make sure everyone was aware of that but there are components that you can use solar with to create that microgrid. So, maybe can you talk to us a little bit about what is the cost breakdown of that microgrid? Then, my part two of the question is how are customers evaluating that return on investment for the resiliency they’re getting on a microgrid?

<strong>Sam</strong>: Yeah, both are good questions. As far as the cost breakdown, it really depends on what kind of option you’re going to want to go with for your microgrid. So, when you do that homework and you figure out kind of what system makes sense, you probably want to come up with a few capital cost options and look at them.

So, things like diesel generators can look cheap upfront at a few hundred dollars a kilowatt hour, but they have kind of low capital costs and higher operating costs and maintenance costs and other things but they don’t come with any savings. Solar has slightly higher upfront costs but the fuel is free. So, you might be getting a payback of something like three to five years on your solar system but it’s coming with higher kind of upfront capital costs.

Batteries in the three hundred to eight-hundred-dollar kilowatt range – a lot of these costs are ranges because they are highly dependent on things like the size and the mounting structure and when you look to the microgrid, you have your generation sources – whatever you kind of deem necessary for your project – and you add maybe 10-20% for a controller and maybe smart switch gear and other things on top of that but it’s also dependent on what your system needs.

And I think the focus on cost is as good thing to think about, but it really misses some of the point that people should be thinking about, “What is my return on investment?” to your second question and how to evaluate that for a resiliency project can be difficult but I tend to think about it as basically, one side of the equation is the grid connected value and savings I can get out of my system plus whatever value I put on resiliency. Basically, it needs to be greater than the capital cost of the system and the O&amp;M cost and then I have a positive business case and I can kind of calculate a standard return on investment the same way I would for any other project.

The tricky part about that tends to be how to value resiliency. So, you can do it kind of like we talked about in the beginning with some kind of macrolevel indicators or you can look at your own particular business and your history of outages and kind of what that may have cost you.

So, one interesting example is trying to look at – sorry, did you want to add something?

<strong>Craig</strong>: No, I was just going to say, you know, your comment earlier that there was this study done that the cost of that downtime was $34 million and I was just, in my head, thinking, “That number seems really small to me.” I mean, it is very contingent on an individual business. Certainly, if you are in a financial services organization, for example, $34 million is maybe what you might lose in a few seconds to a minute, certainly much shorter than a 24-hour period.

So, it’s very dependent on individual customer business and what does that potential downtime mean to them in terms of lost revenue, in terms of risk, reputation, so on and so forth. It’s a very interesting study and I think you’re making the point that it depends very much on the individual business as to what that cost is.

<strong>Sam</strong>: One other point to that is when we do modeling for these projects sometimes, we basically look at what is the financially optimum solution? So, we looked at a project recently for a school and the financially optimum option that would save the school the most money would be about a megawatt of solar, about 200 kilowatts, and 800 kilowatt hours of battery. It was about a 1.3-million-dollar net present value.

If you take that same school and say, “I want us to survive an eight-hour outage,” you basically have a pretty similar sized solar system with a little bit bigger battery. You add in some additional cap x for the microgrid controller. So, your net present value drops a little bit to about $1 million and the point there is not kind of the numbers but it’s basically, in this scenario and a lot of scenarios, you can still get cost savings and resiliency. You might not quite get as a much cost savings but you can have a cost-effective project that also brings resiliency and then if you have a value to that resiliency, that is what pays for that adder whether that means $200,000 or $2 million moving forward with your project.

<strong>Craig:</strong> Yeah. Create a value for it or understand it and sell it to the CFO and the financials, or really the CEO in this case, as you’re getting a cost savings and your resiliency is free, or this is what your resiliency is costing you.

The interesting thing is that it is in part that you are trying to create resiliency so that you can future proof it, right? Because, as I mentioned, we’re always kind of fighting the last war. We’re not sure what’s going to happen, but the trend seems to be going in the opposite direction for resiliency from the grid, specifically in California but it’s not isolated there. There are new challenges, new problems coming up all the time.

Much are weather related that are causing more outages and we get this a lot on the sales side for corporate customers that there is – at the end of the day, they are not in the energy business but they need to protect the downside and risk mitigate it. So, hence there is a lot of interest. Hence, we are having this Solar Tea Time.

So, Sam, I want to go toward wrapping up. It’s a big discussion we could talk about for hours here but, you know, can you maybe talk a little bit more about the challenges that you see to creating this resiliency and investing in these types of services?

<strong>Sam:</strong> Sure. Yeah. So from a technical side, a project I worked on with the military and others, we see a few challenges around things like how do you model the system to make sure it’s going to work in island mode? So this can be somewhat complex.You need to have a good team that understands that you’re basically building a small, isolated power system that needs to balance out – let’s say – variable solar protection. It may need to change some of the kind of system protection settings on your relays and other things for islanded mode and it has kind of a different sort of testing and commissioning protocol than a standard solar system.

So as folks are kind of thinking about this system, that is just kind of a really quick overview. There are a number of unique technical challenges to review and then, often the harder challenge can be that this business case, a lot of times customers have identified that they have a need for resiliency but they don’t know how to do projects and they’re not really sure how to evaluate them.

So, we talked a little bit about those solutions and then kind of one of the number one questions I always get is, “Okay, we want to do it. We’re interested but I don’t have money. How can I move this system forward?” and there are a few companies that offer financing for resiliency solutions and have the ability to basically package the cost savings and the resiliency into kind of a finance resiliency offering. So, that’s one of the things that we’ve worked on that I think has been a big barrier in the past and that is starting to be solved with kind of a finance solution.

So, kind of making the business case and looking for financing and part of that making the business case is really that value and resiliency we talked about and also, some kind of technical challenges.

<strong>Craig:</strong> Yeah, and just to add to that, if you’re trying to sell this project internally, I would certainly try to enlist your CEO, your CFO, or if there is a corporate risk manager. Certainly, you can have an ally in your CTO or CIO on the data center side. It’s something that they have been dealing with forever.

So, when you’re looking to try and find the financing and find the internal funding for this, it’s good to cast kind of a wider breadth than your typical energy project because resiliency, downtime, risk mitigation is something that certainly hits the C level of any company or large organization.

So, Sam, thank you for sharing your insights and helping us, all of our audience, better understand the importance of energy resiliency and also, welcome to the team. Sam comes to us from NREL. So, it’s great to have that kind of experience on our team.

It’s time to wrap up. If you have other questions or want to talk more about this subject or others, feel free to email us and we’ll be sure to get to those questions and hopefully provide you with some good answers. So, on behalf of everyone at REC Solar, cheers. Have a good day!",,,

REC Solar | Duke Energy Renewables, a national leader in US commercial renewable energy financing and zero-emissions solar and wind project development, announced today that the City of Anaheim Public Utilities (City of Anaheim) in Anaheim, California is providing the benefits of solar energy to low-income customers through new solar projects deployed at nine K-12 public schools.

""Solar in schools and public spaces brings so much more to communities than simply reducing emissions and utility bills,” said Matt Walz, CEO REC Solar. ""The City of Anaheim is a great example. The utility meets its targets by licensing land from schools, creating long-term revenue streams for districts and immediate solar structure shade and educational opportunities for students and staff. The solar generated then produces zero-emissions energy for low income residents who may not afford it otherwise. The benefits are truly full circle.""

The City of Anaheim covered 100 percent of the costs to build nine solar sites located in five different school districts. The City developed license agreements to build solar generation on school property, creating new general funds revenue streams that each district can rely on for the next 20 years.

“We approached our need for more solar generation as a way to build win/win partnerships with schools and our community,"" said Mark Brownrigg, Project Manager at the City of Anaheim. ""Like many other cities, land is at a premium and public spaces to build ground mount solar in Anaheim are hard to find. So we had to get creative.""

The City of Anaheim and REC Solar entered into a design-build agreement to build solar structures uniquely suited to each school's needs:
<ul>
 	<li>Solar carports:
<ul>
 	<li>Anaheim Elementary School District's Franklin Elementary and Betsy Ross Elementary schools;</li>
 	<li>Magnolia School District's Lord Baden Powell and Dr. Jonas E. Salk Elementary schools;</li>
 	<li>Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District's Esperanza High School,</li>
 	<li>and Savanna School District’s Hansen Elementary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Solar shade structures:
<ul>
 	<li>Centralia Elementary School District's Centralia Elementary replaced an aging shade structure over the lunch area and Danbrook Elementary gained solar generation weather protection over a popular outdoor play area.</li>
 	<li>Savanna School District’s Cerritos Elementary students escape heat under a new solar structure protecting their school bus pickup and drop-off zone.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
""We can make many energy efficiency upgrades, but nothing stands out quite like driving by a school and seeing the solar panel carports. Our school community especially loves the opportunity to park their car under the shaded structure on a hot day,” said Paul Juarez, Energy Manager for more than 30 schools in Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District. “Our district continues to work aggressively to lower our carbon footprint. Replacing lighting also works great, but solar panel carports in our high school parking lots is the most visible way to ensure our community sees our efforts. Providing students with a new educational experience is a big bonus too.""

Juarez said that high school students created technical renderings for the solar carports so their school board could see how the structures would look when completed. In the future, teachers at all of the schools can create lesson plans and students can monitor and study their site's solar energy production using Green Power Monitoring (GPM) provided by REC Solar.

The solar power generated is not used at the school but instead provides electricity for the City of Anaheim’s <a href=""http://www.anaheim.net/5083/Income-Qualified-Green-Power-Discount"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Income Qualified Green Power Discount</a> program. The program is designed to provide residents with immediate access to the benefits of solar that they may not previously been able to afford or have access to. It also helps the utility meet its goals of transitioning from 29% renewables today to California state mandates of 60% renewable generation by 2030.

The installations at all nine schools are fully operational and the City of Anaheim already has over 400 customers signed up for the Income Qualified Green Power Discount.

Hello everyone. Welcome back to Solar Tea Time. We had a bit of a summer hiatus there. I’m Craig Noxon. I’m the VP of Enterprise Sales here at REC and today we have a very special guest this month. It’s my boss, and CEO of REC Solar, Matt Walz. Matt, welcome. Thanks for joining us.

<strong>Matt:</strong>         Hey, Craig. Thanks for having me.

<strong>Craig:</strong>       Hey there. Yeah, we’ve been trying to book you on for some time now. So, I’m glad you could make time. Before we get started, I’ll do my little housekeeping here. I want you all to be aware that your lines can be muted, however, you can type questions inside the webcast under the questions tab, and we’ll try and get to those by the end of the webcast. If we don’t, we’ll certainly get back to you via email. So, thanks.

Let’s get started with the topic of the day. Matt, you and I were at a conference not too long ago – Smart Energy Decisions – a few months back where you gave the keynote, and you talked about evolution, adaptation around energy choices with businesses and organizations, and I thought we’d pick your brain a little bit more based on those themes.

<strong>Craig:</strong>       We won’t go through the whole presentation, but I did want to take out a few of the highlights. So, I’ve got a couple of questions for you. So, without further ado, we’ll talk a little bit about survival of the fittest.

Matt, you spent the early part of your career at various roles within Duke before moving to REC to become the CEO. So, maybe, you could start by telling us a little bit about how things have changed in the industry and how and why Duke might have come to acquire REC and how that evolution started.

<strong>Matt:</strong>         Yeah. Thanks Craig. I’m happy to start there. You know, when I try to describe to people the industry changes that I see in the industry, the simplest way for me to do it is to share my own person experience. When I joined Duke Energy – maybe 15 years ago – I joined and was on a trading floor where we traded and managed power, fuels, capacity, emission allowances, renewable energy credits, demand response, other products at a wholesale level across a fleet of assets across the country for Duke Energy. It was, without a doubt, one of my most favorite roles and places to work, because it felt like you were at the heart of the power market. You were the heart of the industry. That’s where the action was, and I loved every minute of being on the floor. I loved the diversity of the opinions, the depth of experience, the creativity, the commercial risks and opportunities that they afforded to take, and I learned a ton from the people around me.

Over the course of my career, though, I moved more and more away from the wholesale market toward customers. To be frank, with my first role, I was on a trading floor. We didn’t deal with customers. We dealt with counterparts at the wholesale level, and customers are something off in the distance. Today, and over my career, as more and more opportunities and roles came up for me inside Duke Energy, I found myself – not by plan – moving more and more toward customers and more and more toward renewable energy.

So, today, when I sit in my role today at REC Solar it’s a completely different environment. The excitement and the interest and the opportunities feel very much like the trading floor fifteen years ago in that, today, this feels like we’re at the heart of the markets. This is where the action is in the industry. This is where you’re going to make the most impact. It’s very close to the customer. It’s behind their meter. It’s distributed energy and distributed energy solutions that give them more control and more impact on their energy spend and how it relates to their business. To me, that’s what makes it so exciting. That same passion and excitement of my first job is here today, and I think that’s because that’s where the industry, and the markets, have moved and where the heart of the market is.

The second perspective I have is on Duke Energy and their journey over the last fifteen years. So, there’s a couple of ways I can think about it. One, when I joined Duke Energy, I don’t believe they had any renewable energy investment. Duke Energy Renewables, which is the business that I came from before joining REC Solar, is – maybe – ten years old. In those ten years, it’s invested over 4 billion dollars in wind and solar projects throughout the United States. It made its initial investment in REC Solar to get closer to customers and go from big utility scale projects, like giant wind farms, to behind the meter solutions for customers, both at the commercial and the nonprofit space of the market. So, I see that evolution inside Duke and its commitment to invest in new businesses, new technologies, and significantly increase its share of renewable energy and its generation.

If I look ahead to Duke and their forward outlook, I think every year the outlook for renewable energy to take a greater share of the future generation next in the company has grown year over year over the last 10 years. That’s a very simple last perspective from a Duke standpoint and I think it says a lot. When I joined Duke Energy, I don’t recall the word “customer” being used. It was rate pair. It was a rate pair and how do we think about rate pairs in our service territories? Today, if I’m in a Duke Energy meeting, there is a customer message up front, and we only talk about customers and how do we deliver more choices to them that are cleaner and build to a smarter energy future that is at the heart of where Duke is going to go and be successful going forward.

<strong>Craig:</strong>       Matt, you talked a little bit about choices – more choices for customers, more of a customer first attitude among Duke, and I assume, other utilities, things generally getting better, and that’s the evolutions. So, from a customer’s perspective, why not wait? Why not just say, “Listen, things are getting better. Renewable will go down over time.” Why not just sit and wait until that happens a little more?

<strong>Matt:</strong>         There are two dynamics to that. One is, what’s possible today, and I think one could say there’s a lot of changes. They’ve been coming a lot. Maybe they show up even more in the future. So, why not just wait to see how solar storage, microgrids, and other digitalization of the internet, and everything, shows up? Just like your iPhone – or I remember when I had a Blackberry and that was the greatest cell phone ever. Today it’s an iPhone. Like, why not wait for the next generation to come out?

I would say the reason not to wait is because the expectations from your customers and your other stakeholders – like employees and investors – are that you are going to move forward. You don’t want to wait, because, I think, you are going to lose two things. One is the longer you wait, the less relevant you could be for your customers.

From my personal experience, if I think about books, twenty years ago I lived in Chicago. There was fantastic Borders on Michigan Avenue. I spent a lot of time in that. It was the greatest place for me in terms of experiencing books, exploring books, finding books, and everything around them. Today I wouldn’t even think of that as an option. I go to Amazon. I don’t even read them. I listen to them on Audible. My expectations have moved, materially, as a customer, with what’s possible, with what’s been shown to me and delivered to me. My expectations have moved away from what was a great experience. So, now, it’s not an acceptable experience.

I think, when it comes to renewable energy, you’ve got to understand that there’s an expectation. Your competitors are doing it. If you are thinking about this, your competitors are out there doing it. Just look at the RE100 or other metrics out there of who is signing up for big sustainability goals. Your stakeholders expect it, not just your customers. Your employees require you to have a clean, sustainable footprint. Investors, frankly, more and more expect you to have sustainability goals and to tie that to your long-term strategy. So, I see it as an expectation that you should not ignore.

We talked about evolution a little bit. I think Darwin says it best. He said, “It’s not the strongest of the species that will survive, nor the most intelligent, but the one most adaptable to change.” By not changing, by not adapting, that is not a good business plan. It’s been well proven, and it’s not a good business plan for businesses or a species. You have to adapt with change.

If that doesn’t resonate, I’ve seen a number of customers that are drawn to sustainability, but they act on savings. Those that made decisions to invest in onsite solar, or renewable energy, did it last year, the year before, or even five years ago and got many happy customers that are saving off the systems that were available then and are happy with those investments. So, if you boil it down to one thing, by waiting you are forgoing the opportunity to save and lower your cost structure tied to energy.

<strong>Craig:</strong>       So, I just want to pick up on something. You talked a little bit about evolution and you mentioned the Blackberry and the iPhone or orders to Amazon. So, that kind of disruptive technology, in those cases – Airbnb, Amazon, Uber – that’s a revolution.

So, is this disruptive technology? Is it an evolution – DG and renewable energy – or is it a revolution? How do you see that?

<strong>Matt:</strong>         You know, I’d say that if I look at it with my industry hat on, this is evolutionary. These are small changes that add up. So, at the end of the day, a behind-the-meter solar system is still producing electrons – the same type of electrons that a centralized generation powerplant from 25 years ago would have produced and delivered safely, affordably, and reliably to a customer’s business. It involves a similar technology. You have inverters. You have wiring. You have steel. You have similar components. So, I think there’s one argument to be made that this is just a continuous improvement on the same technology.

You can look at it in modules. The production of modules, over time, has gotten better, faster, and cheaper. Inverters have gotten better, faster, and cheaper. The components are – I jokingly say – it’s not like it’s the flux capacitor from Back to the Future. These are founded in the technologies that were at the heart of centralized generation 20 years ago, but they are applied in a way that enables it to be done onsite, and it can be done emission-free, and it can be done in a way that saves more money for that customer.

I think where it becomes revolutionary is when this takes off and gets to scale, and you get this critical mass of it in the market. That really becomes revolutionary for our economy, for those that want to avoid climate change, the environment, people’s way of controlling their energy spend and managing in their business and connecting to their overall strategy. That feels like where it becomes revolutionary. How you apply it becomes revolutionary, but I think at the end of the day a solar system on your roof is an evolution of what has been out there for decades.

<strong>Craig:</strong>       Yeah, still delivering electrons to you house and, in some ways, going back to how it used to be before utilities. People would have their own energy with the windmill.

<strong>Matt:</strong>         Yeah, exactly.

<strong>Craig:</strong>       So, going full circle, how should customers be thinking from their own perspectives? How could they be thinking about these energy decisions and making these evolutionary steps? Can you help us with the framework?

<strong>Matt:</strong>         I think the framework that seems to resonate, and is common across our customers, is the three C’s. It’s clean, cost, and control. If you frame your decision making around being cleaner, less costly, and getting more control over your energy, you will be able to make the right decisions for your business, not only to shape the choices and apply them to your business, but, also, to syndicate it and talk about it with the larger stakeholders within your business, because most of the time it’s not an individual’s decision about on-site solar, or PPAs, or other investments. It is an organizational decision within our customers. That framework will help shape a good decision, and then, also help those that are championing it to navigate it and get it approved and accepted within a larger organization. So, just focus on those three things – cleaner, less costly, and more control.

Then, the last thing I’d say is, my perspective is, we’re working with several companies and organizations that are leading the vanguard in this area about how to bring solar and renewable energy into their business. Every one of them is charting their own path. There isn’t one standard formula on how you do it. There are those that are focused on onsite solar. Some are looking to offsite solutions. There are folks that want to bring resiliency into their behind the meter distributed energy solutions. So, they bring in solar plus microgrid to bring value – not to just have lower energy, but to bring value to critical infrastructure in their community. I see it in those that want to own their systems versus those that want to have someone own the system and operate it for them.

There isn’t one solution for everybody. So, if you think about those three C’s and then you have the understanding that you can listen and learn from a lot of what other people have done, by the end of the day you should chart the strategy that makes the most sense for you business, and it’s okay that you’re doing it differently than others.

With that, what I’m excited about is that I believe REC and Duke Energy Renewables combined – our mission to be that energy partner for people in the market really fits well with the three C’s and, then, helping people navigate how to connect with their strategy.

When I look at the heart of our business, the brand that we stand for is built on stewardship, ownership, and bankability. Stewardship – we are committed to making a positive impact on the world. Ownership – we’re not a consultant. We’re not a developer looking to flip it. We are long-term owners of assets. That’s the heart and soul of REC and Duke Energy. We’re not here to just advise customers on what they should do. We’re not here to build what they do. We’re here to do those two plus own and operate where applicable. Then, the last part, that bankability – I firmly believe our brand is founded on what we do lining up with what we say. We can leverage the balance sheet of Duke. Our word is our bankability and the balance sheet of Duke brings that to bare for our customers and ties into our bankability.

<strong>Craig:</strong>       When you were talking, I thought of two other C’s which is customer choice, which seems to be part of the evolution. There’s more choice now than ever, and that’s just continuing.

Matt, I want to thank you. We’re just about out of time. Thanks for your insights. Thanks for joining us for Solar Tea Time. I hope to have a cup of tea with you.

I’ll wrap up, but if anyone would like to talk to REC or Duke Energy Renewables more about how to adapt your own energy mix and leverage renewables, feel free to email us. You can also email us with questions, and we’ll certainly get back with you.

So, thank you Matt.

<strong>Matt:</strong>         Thank you Craig.

<strong>Craig:</strong>       On behalf of everyone at REC, cheers. Have a great day. Bye",,,

Craig: Hello everyone. Welcome to Solar Tea Time. I’m Craig Noxon, VP of Enterprise Sales. Once again, we have a very special guest with us, Drew Dickson, managing director of business development at Duke Energy Renewables. Hello Drew.

Drew: Hello Craig.

Craig: Alright. So Drew and Duke Energy Renewables will be our guests. This is a 301 series. We have done a 101 and a 201 thus far on offsite renewables. Today, we are going to focus a little bit more on <a href=""https://sustainablesolutions-duke-energy-com-staging.go-vip.net/solutions/off-site-renewables/vppa/"">VPPAs</a>. So, before we get started, a little housekeeping as always. Just wanted to make everyone aware that your line is going to be muted. However, you can type questions inside the web chat under the questions tab. We’ll try to get to those questions at the end of the webcast. If not, we would certainly get back to you after this. So Drew, welcome once again to Solar Tea Time. We appreciate you joining us. Today, we’re going to talk a little bit more about VPPAs. We’ll start with that acronym. Drew, let us know- Actually, maybe you can get us started with a little bit of a rundown of what we’ve covered thus far with 101 and 201 series.

Drew: Yeah. happy to. So, for the listeners who may not have heard our 101 and 201 Solar Tea Time sessions the last couple of months, I’ll give you a quick replay. The 101 session, we really covered energy market structures. So, we compared the more traditional vertically integrated utility market versus what we might call an organized market like an ISO or and RTO. We compared those. We talked about reasons customers could potentially buy renewable energy from an offsite project. Whether it’s solar or wind. Just a quick recap. Some of those reasons might be onsite economics don’t make sense. Or the logistics for onsite solar might not make sense in a particular location. We also covered some of the benefits of an offsite renewable energy projects. The scale. Just the large scale of these projects and then the large impact that can translate into in terms of renewable energy green house gas emission reduction goals. And just the simplicity of administering once contract or a handful of contracts versus potentially dozens or hundreds. Or a large multisite retailer as an example.

So that was 101. Then, in Solar Tea Time 201 on offsite renewables last month last month, we talked a little bit about energy markets but we talked about markets where offsite renewable energy transactions can work. We talked about some utility programs, such as green tariffs, where there are opportunities to buy offsite renewables through your local utility in a few markets. Then we spent the bulk of the 201 session really discussing what is a Virtual Power Purchase Agreement or a VPPA. So, an overview of mechanics time, how a VPPA works, what some of the critical components are and what some of the considerations are for buyers who are interested in entering into a VPPA.

Craig: So, just as a reminder, these webcasts are posted on our website. You can get to those through recsolar.com. Under resources and library. So, thanks for that Drew. Maybe let’s get into a topic of the day. Maybe you can help us.
<h3>What are some of the common issues around VPPA and how can our customers overcome some of those issues?</h3>
Drew: Sure. So, I’ll go back quickly again to our 201 session. At the end of 201, I talked about a few considerations that a buyer interested in a VPPA may want to consider. Walk over those again just quickly and then I’ll introduce a few new new considerations as well. So, previously, we talked about term. So, these tend to be long-term transactions, typically 12 to up to 20 years in term. So that, for a lot of companies tends to be a relatively long term and something that is often outside the planning horizon when they typically procure products or commodities. So the long-term nature is certainly a consideration. The credit is another one we touched on. Because these VPPAs really are the primary revenue vehicles for a new wind farm or a new solar farm, investors and lenders will look to the VPPA and the credit quality of the counter party staying behind that VPPA really as a critical piece of the total project. So, typically, we see the counter parties or the buyers entering into these VPPAs with investment grade credit ratings or in the absence of an investment grade credit rating, being able to provide a guarantee from an investment grade rated entity. Or a letter of credit. Or some other type of more liquid credit score that can be posted to back that party’s obligations. So, term, credit. Then, the third one we touched on was just the seller experience, seller capabilities. If the party you’re dealing with. Have they done this before? Right? Do they have the experience? The where with all? Do they have the financial to pull this off?

So, just knowing who your counter party is. Knowing who you trust in the transaction and whether or not that party will be there for the long haul as a long term owner operator. So those a few of the considerations we touched on previously. I’ll introduce a few new ones for the group as well. These are sort of, I’ll call them issues. But, they’re resolvable. They’re addressable. The industry has been able to come up with solutions for these issues. So, I don’t mean to scary anyone that there are major obstacles out there. I think these obstacles I’m talking about are well known. There are solutions to addressing them. So, the first couple of really have to do with accounting. Accounting issues in these Virtual Power Purchase Agreements. One of the first components of that would be derivative accounting. So, VPPAS, as we discussed, are contracts for differences. The parties exchange payments every month. One party is paying a fixed payment. The other party’s exchanging that for floating payment. If the contract were treated as a derivative for accounting rules, that could have an impact on the profit and loss as the price fluctuates every month or quarter. That gain or that loss could be reflected on the buyer’s financial statements, which most buyers don’t want to see.

Now the good news is that, for accounting purposes, most derivatives have to have a specified volume or a minimum volume. So you can structure the VPPA in a way where you avoid volumes and therefore you can avoid derivative treatment. So, I’ll give you an example of that.

Most VPPAs, virtual or otherwise, have some kind of production requirement. Or some kind of production standards. So the wind farm or the solar project has to deliver a certain quantity of energy, certain percentage of what’s expected every year. If the project owner fails to deliver that quantity, then there’s some kind of penalty or some kind of liquidated damage that gets paid. But rather than structuring that with a megawatt hour volume, you could structure that in a different way. You can use generally what we refer to as availability percentage. Get to that same concept but just doing it in a different way.

For those of you who don’t have as much experience in the power industry and may not be as familiar with availability. It’s basically just a concept that we use and it applies to fossil plants that have fostered renewable plants. It’s basically the percentage of hours of the year that a plant was capable, online, available and capable of generating. So, there’s sort of different ways you can structure to the same results so that the seller or the owner of a project has some obligation to deliver energy of a certain quantity. Or for a certain number of hours. But, doing it in a way that avoids the derivative accounting treatment. Another accounting issue is consolidation. So these projects are large. They’re large capital investments. There’s typically equity and debt associated with raising the capital to build these wind and solar facilities. That’s always on the seller’s side of the books, right?

The project owner’s side of the books. But, if the project or the VPPA were consolidated, it’s possible that that capital and that debt could be translated onto the VPPA buyers books. Which, again, most VPPA buyers want to avoid that. Consolidation can be triggered by a number of things. Mostly through operational rights to control the facility. So, if the buyer of the VPPA could dictate when the maintenance was performed or how the energy was sold into the market. Things like that. Or, potentially, if the VPPA were treated as a lease for lease accounting purposes. Or as a capital lease that can also lead to potential consolidation. So, there are known issues. The good news is you can structure around them by leaving those material project risks with the project owner that you can avoid consolidation. So, as I said, these are things that can be structurally resolved the way that VPPA is entered into.

They’re pretty well known in the accounting and the auditing community. So, it’s something you should be aware of as you think about a VPPA. As you work in your organization to potentially implement a VPPA. But they’re not things that aren’t necessarily deal killers. Instruction proper. I guess Craig, the other thing I’ll touch on in terms of risks or issues in a VPPA is it’s just what I’ll generally call risk management. So because these are longer term transactions, as a buyer, you need to ultimately get comfortable that you hold this long-term position. That position is influenced by future market energy prices. If those future market energy prices fall, you could potentially lose money. That’s the risk management item. I think the critical thing there is to get your treasury team. Get your CFO or your risk management team involved in the transaction early. Work with them to help analyze that risk.

And you know, the good news is there are experts out there. There’s a handful of firms out there that do market price forecasts. Their fundamental forecasts are based on assumptions about supply and demand and interest rates and the cost of natural gas and any other number of assumptions and variables. They can predict with some margin of error, obviously, what they believe the market energy prices will be in the future on kind of a base case scenario. But, then, also on different upside or downside cases. So, I think as a buyer interested in entering into a VPPA, understanding what some of those downside cases look like for you. If marketing energy prices do fall. Working with your organization, discussing that with your treasury and your risk management team to make sure you can appreciate that, you’re able to budget for that and accommodate that in a downside case. That I think is one of the most critical issues in a VPPA. Getting that through an organization, getting comfortable with that. So, really, the key for these is communication, right? So, there are a number of complex issues that we’ve touched on. Engaging your team and your organization to review these issues, to come up with resolutions. And reporting out those findings, your stakeholders, whether they be internal or external, will minimize surprises. It’ll be much more beneficial in the future for your organization to identify these issues, to communicate that out rather than keep your folks in the dark if you’re looking at implementing a VPPA. So, all these issues can be addressed. Just different ways to do them.

Craig: Yeah, certainly. So you’re saying don’t just be like Genghis Khan and take over everybody. Build some consensus. Make some sense. You talked a little bit of a treasury and CFO. Can you talk a little bit more about different people that they should be reaching out to internally?
<h3>What resources should people be talking about to help them with this type of a decision and that consensus building?</h3>
Drew: So, again, every organization is going to be different. So, for the folks on the call, they’ll appreciate some of these organizations. Or some of these parts of their organization may apply, may not apply. You’ll know which of these are important in your organization. If I were to come up with a checklist of teams or groups that you would want involved in a VPPA transaction, I’ll start with treasury, right? And someone senior, like a treasurer or a CFO, is typically involved in these types of transactions within an organization implementing these because of the financial impact, because of the risk management actually we discussed. Accounting, right? So we’ve talked about some of the accounting issues that can be structured around. So. having your accountants or your auditors engaged, I think would be very important.

Make sure they understand those issues. Make sure that they’re comfortable with the VPPA as you’ve structured it. Does it have any undesirable accounting treatments or outcomes? Certainly your attorneys. Your law firm. Your in house folks. These VPPAs are complex legal documents like many others. So, having your attorneys review them. Having their input on particular terms and conditions I think is very important and will help you streamline your approval process. The next one, I’ll call generically sort of facilities/ operations. This, depending on your organization, can vary quite a bit. The folks within your group that are managing your energy decisions today. Whether that’s a plant manager who has P&amp;L responsibility for his energy costs. Or whether that’s an operations group. Whoever’s managing your energy today, utility billing, etc. That organization, having someone represented, I think will be very helpful to implement a VPPA in a way that works for your organization, and helps you accomplish your objectives. The next one might be a procurement. So you know whether you’re buying a commodity. Whether you’re buying staples and paperclips. Most large organizations have some kind of procurement process or supply chain organization. That’s a group that depending on your status, may or may not need to get involved in this type of transaction.

Sustainability, I think, is really critical. So again, the reason most organizations are considering a Virtual Power Purchase Agreement is for some type of sustainability focused effort. Whether that’s the greenhouse gas emissions reduction goal. Whether that’s the renewable energy goal. Whether that’s some other target you’re trying to solve. So your sustainability team who understands those orders, those goals. Whether it’s the way you report your different scope of GHG targets. Whether it’s the commitments you’ve made publicly about your sustainability objectives and targets. Having that team involved and understanding what you’re doing and how you’re structuring the VPPA. I think will be very critical to satisfy those larger corporate objectives that you might have already communicated to the street. Which takes me to the next group which would be public relations, right? So, most organizations who do a VPPA really want to broadcast what they’ve done.

It’s an exciting transaction. It’s certainly newsworthy. I think most organizations want to communicate the goodwill and good efforts they’ve done to their stakeholders, whether it’s employees, whether it’s supply chain partners or the general public. So, your PR organization I think would be helpful to have involved. And, finally, I’ll end the checklist with an executive sponsor. That could honestly be anyone from the above groups we’ve talked about. It could be the treasurer or CFO. But, generally having an executive sponsor who can throw some weight behind a project like this, demonstrate that this is of importance to the organization, will help implement these VPPAs in a much faster and more streamlined manner.
<h3>What kind of support can people turn to, external to their own organization?</h3>
Drew: The good news is there’s a lot of resources out there. You will not be the first one doing this VPPA transaction. There’s a lot of others who have come before you. Solved of these same issues and overcome some of these same obstacles. So, I’ll rattle off a list of external resources that I think would be helpful for anyone looking at this for the first time.

So, first one I’ll mention is the BRC, Business Renewable Center. It’s a nonprofit organization. It’s an outgrowth of the Rocky Mountain Institute. And BRC is really an association of interested parties. Whether they be buyers. Whether they be sellers. Or other service providers. That are all focused on these types of transactions and advancing this market. Trying to address issues and break down barriers to the wider adaptation of large scale renewable purchases by corporate entities. So BRC is a great resource. I would check them out if you’re not familiar with them.

The second one I would look at is what I’ll generically call renewable energy advisors and consultants. There’s a handful of these folks out there. I won’t name any by name because I don’t want to necessarily endorse or not endorse any of them. But these are folks that you might already be doing with your organization on things like utility bill management or sustainability target development or renewable energy credit purchasing. So, a number of these organizations have sort of shifted into this offsite VPPA advisory role as this market has matured. So, there’s a number of those folks out there that can provide sort of consultancy and advisory work almost exclusively for buyers in these types of transactions. External legal counsel. Right? As more and more law firms work on these transactions, there’s a lot of attorneys out there who have sort of built a knowledge base of these transactions. The terms and conditions that are acceptable in the market.

Finally, I would just say someone who can be a trusted energy partner. Someone like Duke Energy and REC Solar. Someone who’s done these transactions. Has the experience with the wherewithal to back them up. Someone who can work with you to help address your challenges and meet your objectives. Make the process of putting onsite or offsite renewables as simple and as streamlined as we can for you to meet your objectives.

Craig: Thanks Drew. So, with that, we’ll wrap up. So thanks so much for your time and helping us better understand VPPAs. And for the whole series about offsite renewables. It’s been great. I think we’re going to wrap this moth’s Solar Tea Time up. I believe we’re going to take a slight hiatus in July. But be back August with Solar Tea Time. Again, if you have any questions, you want to reach out to us on this topic or any others. Please email us. We’ll be sure to get back to you. So thanks Drew. Cheers. Thanks a lot. Take care. Bye.",,,

Craig Noxon: Hi everybody. Welcome to Solar Tea Time. I’m Craig Noxon, the VP of Enterprise Sales at REC Solar and we have our first-ever returning guest. Drew Dickson, Managing Director of Business Development from Duke Energy Renewables. Welcome back Drew.

Drew Dickson: Thank you.

Craig Noxon: We’re going to follow up from the last discussion we had, which was a 101 series talking about our continued journey through offsite renewables with basically a 201 series focusing a little bit more on some of the strategies and purchasing vehicles for offsite renewables.

Drew, welcome back. We appreciate you joining us to dive a little deeper into offsite renewables. Let’s just jump right in. Basic questions here. Can you talk a little bit about the markets for offsite?
<h3>Why might customers pursue offsite energy, and what strategies might they deploy?</h3>
Drew Dickson: Happy to, Craig. In the 101 webinar last month, for those of you who participated, we talked a lot about different market structures, regulated utility markets versus organized markets. We’ll touch on a few of those points again here today in more detail. In general, when it comes to markets where these transactions are getting done, these offsite renewable energy transactions are getting done. There’s what I would differentiate between regulated markets and these organized markets.

To start with a little history: A number of years ago, due to customer interest, a lot of utilities launched what we would call green pricing programs, which enable their customers to procure renewable energy or buy RECs [renewable energy credits] essentially from the utility for an incremental cost on top of what they were already paying for retail electric service. These programs caught on and a number of utilities launched these programs around the country. Ultimately, whether the utility was buying those RECs from third party independent generators, or whether the utility was sourcing those RECs from wind and solar assets that they themselves owned and operated, essentially it was being passed through as as a cost-add to the rate base. The benefits of the fixed price energy that renewable energy projects can offer was not really shared with the ultimate end use customer.

The more recent structure we’ve seen in utility tariffs in these regulated markets for green energy has been these green tariffs. Sort of simply named. These work differently in different markets in different states. By and large, these green tariffs enable renewable energy to be passed from the generator through utility to an ultimate end-use customer. In a lot of the cases, the fixed price, long-term value of that renewable energy can be passed to the end-use customer as well. A great example of this is in Nevada, where NV energy has a nice green pricing tariff. Or, apologies, green tariff, which is basically slips through from the renewable energy developer all the way through the utility to the end-use customer. These green tariffs exist in probably about 13 states today. Not every utility in those states has a green tariff and not even every customer in those utility markets or in that state have access to that green tariff.

It’s still a very small percentage of load in the US can access a green tariff. Beyond green tariffs, there are a number of states, I think about six today, that have done some type of bilateral one-off renewable energy transaction between a renewable generator and an end customer. Maybe outside of a green tariff program. There’s a number of programs out there. They really vary state to state in these regulated markets. If this is something that you’re interested in, I would point you to WRI. The World Resources Institute puts out some issue briefs and papers occasionally on the development of these various tariff products that are helpful. Everything we’ve covered until this point has been in a regulated utility framework. Let me switch now to talk more about the organized markets. We covered this a lot in the 101 session. Organized markets that cover the whole center of the country and a lot of the markets up in the northeast and in California offer more tools, more ability for customers to buy renewable energy from offsite projects.

If you’re tuning into the webinar, the map that you’re seeing now shows you where these organized markets are around the country. They are called independent system operators. Sometimes, they’re called regional transmission organizations but I’ll just generically refer to them today as organized markets. These markets are where the preponderance of renewable energy transactions are taking place today in the US with offsite projects and offsite customers. These markets offer a few benefits. They offer access first and foremost. As an independent generator, we now have access to a market. We’re not relying on the sort of incumbent utility to buy that power. It opens up in a broad range of customers for us as a generator. On the flip, for those of you who are customers of energy, this opens up new avenues and new contracting structures for you as well in these markets.

These markets that are shaded on the map are markets where the structures exist. The fundamentals are in place for offsite renewable energy purchasing to take place at a large scale. But, I’ll caution that it doesn’t necessarily make economic sense in every one of these markets today. For example, New England, I’ll just point out, has the market structures in place to enable offsite virtual power purchase agreements. But because of relatively low wholesale energy rates and the relative higher costs of new build, wind and solar in these markets, New England is an example where we just haven’t seen a lot of renewable energy transactions done offsite. However, if you look at the center of the country – Texas, all throughout the Southwest power pool and into the Midwest, even in PJM in the Northeast. We’ve seen a lot of renewable energy transactions take place in these markets because the new levelized cost of wind and solar new build is very competitive today with wholesale power prices in a lot of those markets.

Craig Noxon: Interestingly because from an outside perspective, Massachusetts, for example, is great. Mostly because they have such a great incentive program. You really have to look at what site you’re in and what makes the most sense for you. That’s going to differ for each customer based on location. Let me ask you, Drew.
<h3>What does the offsite renewable transaction structure look like?</h3>
Drew Dickson: Great question. There’s not one easy answer to that question. So I’ll address it in a couple of ways. There’s basically two ways a customer can buy renewable energy from an offsite project. Again, I’m greatly simplifying here. The first way, and this is a pretty rare type of transaction, would be the purchase of physical electricity. A physically delivered power purchase agreement. Really only the largest and most sophisticated buyers have been able to execute these physically delivered contracts. An example would be Google or Apple or even Walmart have gone through the effort and gone through the steps and the cost of setting up essentially a wholesale power trading business. Getting the regulatory approvals necessary from FERC and others to transact wholesale electricity is not really for the faint of heart. It is relatively expensive. And the expertise required to build this capability is difficult. The very giant energy consumers around the country – the data center guys and retailers like Walmart – have occasionally done these types of transactions. But, they’re definitely in the minority of the transactions that have been done to date.

That takes me to the easier and perhaps the simpler transaction. And the one that’s much more common today. That is not taking physical delivery of the electricity from an offsite project, but taking what we would call financial settlement. You’ll hear us refer to this in the industry as a virtual PPA or a <a href=""https://sustainablesolutions-duke-energy-com-staging.go-vip.net/solutions/off-site-renewables/vppa/"">Virtual Power Purchase Agreement</a>. We throw around the word virtual. All it really means that it’s a financially settled contract between the buyer and the seller. The buyer, the corporate customer or the institution on the buying end of the transaction is not actually taking physical delivery of electricity. We’ll walk through an example of that shortly. As real energy generators, we are in the wholesale markets everyday transacting wholesale power in an organized market. That’s our daily business. It makes sense for us to manage that wholesale daily power interaction in the wholesale market. And for a customer to focus on their core business, which for most of you is not buying wholesale electricity for a long time.
<h3>What exactly does a Virtual Power Purchase Agreement, or VPPA, look like?</h3>
I’ll break this up into components that I think will help walk everyone through and make this pretty straightforward. I’m actually going to start on the bottom. Particularly the bottom right of this graphic. So you have a customer. Here I’ve titled it a corporate buyer but, again, the same would apply to an institution or a university or someone that’s not necessarily a corporation. You have a transaction between a corporation or a buyer and utility. This is your daily electricity consumption at the retail level, right? Every time you flip on a light switch or turn on a manufacturing process, you’re burning electricity, you’re buying that electricity from your regulated utility or in markets that are deregulated, you might have a retail electric supplier that you’ve chosen to serve your retail load. That’s the transaction at the bottom right of this graphic. That ought to be familiar to everyone. A VPPA does not change that. I’ll come back and talk about that in a moment.

Now, if you look at the bottom left of this graphic, your utility company is either generating electricity themselves from power plants that they own and operate. Or, perhaps, they’re buying it in a wholesale market from other independent generators. The utility itself is either generating or purchasing electricity from a wholesale market and eventually passing electricity through to a customer at the retail level. The bottom half of this graphic is pretty straightforward. That’s kind of status quo. How most folks purchase their electricity today.

Let me switch and talk a little bit about the top of the graphic. I’ll start at the top left and that’s between the Renewal Energy Project, the wind farm or the solar farm and the wholesale market itself. Recall the graphic earlier with all the colored regions of the country. ERCOT, SPP, MISO, these organized markets. The Renewal Energy Project sells its electricity at the hourly level into that market and the Renewal Energy Project receives that market price for the energy in that interval, whether it’s hourly or even sub hourly on many markets. We call that the floating price. Depending on supply and demand, the market clearing price for that electricity in that interval will be priced differently. That is the floating price that the renewable energy project receives from the wholesale market. As a generator, that’s our core business, right? That’s how we interact with the market and that’s how we traditionally get paid. Nothing I’ve told you to date or till now is a VPPA, right? That’s all just sort of setting the stage for what is the actual VPPA itself. That’s essentially what’s in the box that’s in the top right of the graph.

The Renewal Energy Project receives the floating price from the system operator in the market and it passes that floating price directly through to the customer, to the corporate buyer, right? So that’s a direct pass through. In exchange, the corporate buyer pays the renewable energy project a fixed price per megawatt hour. So corporate buyer receives a floating price and they pay a fixed price. That’s the financial settlement that we talk about in a VPPA. This is also referred to as a contract for differences or maybe even a financially settled contract for differences. The terminology changes a fair amount between VPPA and and these other tools. But by and large it’s the exchange of a fixed payment for floating payment or vice versa depending on what end of the transaction you’re sitting on. The most important part of all of this, and the reason we’re doing all of this in the first place, is that the RECS, the renewable energy benefits apply to the corporate buyer.

They are issued in some kind of tracking system to the renewable energy project owner and they get passed through under this VPPA to the corporate buyer. So, they ultimately can make the claim that they bought renewable energy. That really, in simplicity, is what a virtual power purchase agreement is and how it works. I guess one of the things that I can touch on here is that we started at the bottom of the diagram taking out how your meters are actually served with retail power from your utility. That really doesn’t change, right? You’re still served by your retail supplier, by your company utility, at the retail level, monthly. That doesn’t change in a VPPA. It’s really the financial settlement you have with the renewable generator that gives you a head potentially against rising electricity costs. You can then apply towards your retail rate and basically have an offsetting long to your short position as a retail right there.

Craig Noxon: It’s important to note, in your box up here, while it may look like energy may be passing from the renewable project to the corporate buyer, that it’s not. The actual energy, the electrons are not directly flowing and that’s the distinction between the PPA and the virtual PPA. We’re really now just dealing with, as you said, there’s contractor differences.

Drew Dickson: Yeah.

Craig Noxon: That’s great Drew. Appreciate that. My last question here is:
<h3>What are some other factors that a corporate buyer should consider?</h3>
You kind of mentioned earlier that some VPPAs are only for some of the largest corporations in the country, but there are ways that others can take advantage of this. What else should they be thinking about?

Drew Dickson: Absolutely. I know in our next session, the 301 session, we’ll cover some more nuanced topics. But, I think there’s three today that I’ll touch on that are probably the biggest factors or the biggest considerations that a prospective purchaser of renewable energy from offsite should take into consideration.

The first one is term. These VPPAs from the Renewal Energy Project’s perspective are the primary revenue contract, right? They describe how we get paid; for how long we get paid. They really are the cornerstone of a renewable energy project. It’s the basis for how we would finance the construction of a new solar farm or a new wind farm. In that context, I’ll bring up the term of the VPPA because the term can be an issue for a number of buyers because they tend to be relatively long. Most VPPAs we’re seeing today are between 12 and 20 years in duration. A 15 year term is very common. Even in terms as long as 25 years are not unheard of. This 12 to 20 year time horizon tends to be where the most overlap between buyer interest and seller interest lies and that’s because of that long-term revenue certainty that the renewable energy project requires to raise financing and justify the expenditure of the capital investment to build the facility.

I know a lot of buyers probably don’t purchase anything for 12 years or 20 years into the future. Certainly that is a consideration and these transactions that a buyer should consider. The next one I’ll touch on is credit. Kind of goes hand in hand with term, right? So this is a financially settled transaction. One party is going to be paying the other party in any given month for the duration of this contract. That raises credit issues, right? On both sides of the transaction, to be perfectly frank. We’re relying on the buyer to be there to make these payments. In the same vein, the buyer is relying on us as the project owner or the seller to be there and to live up to our obligations in the contract as well.

We’re each taking credit exposure to the other. As a result, generally these transactions are structured with some level of credit support being provided from one party to the other. Usually that’s reciprocal. Both parties are providing credit support to the other. From the buyer’s perspective, the consideration they should have there is are they investment-grade credit rated? If not, do they have a parent company or an affiliate there can provide guarantee from an investment-grade rated entity? And if they’re not investment-grade rated, well that’s not necessarily a deal killer. There are other other tools and other techniques we can use. There’s letters of credit. There’s performance bonds. There’s other other packages and instruments we can use to provide credit support to one another, just to make sure that the contract will be fully settled for the term.

Finally Craig, I’ll leave with experience. Quite frankly, there are a number of sellers in this market. Some are experienced. Some are not as experienced. This is a long-term relationship. Whether it’s the front end, the construction, the negotiating the contract. Or the long end and the back end, the operations and maintenance and settlement of the contract for the term. You want to know who you’re doing business with and who your counter party is and do they have the financial and technical wherewithal to do what they say they’re going to do. I think that’s another serious consideration for buyers. Knowing who your supplier is and getting comfortable with their experience and their credit and their wherewithal.

Craig Noxon: That’s great Drew. Thanks. That wraps up this session. It’s been great. We received a lot of interest in how corporates can employ offsite renewables as part of their overall energy strategy. As with the last session, if we didn’t get to your questions, please email us. We’ll be sure to get back to you and, as Drew mentioned, we will have a 301 in an upcoming Solar Tea Time. Please stay tuned. Drew, enjoy your tea. Enjoy your rest of the day. Thanks everybody. Take care. Bye.

Drew Dickson: Thank you. Thank you all.",,,

Hello everyone and welcome to Solar Tea Time!

I’m Craig Noxon, VP of Enterprise Sales and we have a very special guest expert for this month, Drew Dickson, Managing Director, Business Development at Duke Energy Renewables. Drew and Duke Energy Renewables will be our guest in our new four-part series of Solar Tea Times discussing offsite renewables. Today we are focused on how energy markets work.

Before we get started, a little housekeeping. I wanted you to all be aware that your line is muted but you can type questions inside of the webcast under the questions tab. We will try to answer questions at the end of the webcast or we will get back to you via email. OK, that’s it for the logistics. Let’s get to the topic of the day, tips from Cal Poly on going solar.

Drew, welcome to Solar Tea Time. We appreciate you and Duke Energy Renewables joining us. Since Duke Energy fully acquired REC Solar back in December, we’ve been working closely together on new ways to bring both onsite and offsite solar and wind to customers as well as microgrids and storage. We’ve gotten a lot of questions about the benefits of doing onsite vs offsite so we thought it would be great to have you on as our expert to help explain.  So, without further ado, let’s start talking about offsite! First Question:
<h3>What is an energy market and why should I care?</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>The vast majority of electrical generation operates in the wholesale market</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>
<ul>
 	<li>
<ul>
 	<li>Conventional fossil-fired generation, wind, large solar – everything except for distributed resources (behind the meter)</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>The utility or retail provider who serves your load either generates their own electricity or purchases it in the wholesale market</li>
 	<li>Markets are regionalized
<ul>
 	<li>some traditional vertically integrated utilities operate their own wholesale markets that may just cover part of a state or parts of several states where they serve load
<ul>
 	<li>examples – western US (except CA), southeast</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Other “organized” markets can cover many states – for instance the Southwest Power Pool (SPP) covers parts of 14 states from Oklahoma to the Canadian border</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>These organized markets have transparent pricing, liquid trading hubs, and offer coordinated regional transmission planning and efficient dispatch of connected generators to serve load at the lowest cost</li>
 	<li>These organized markets allow for independent generators to build power plants and sell power into the market or to third parties – opening an avenue to non-traditional energy buyers to access the wholesale power market</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why would a customer buy renewable energy from an offsite project?</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>
<ul>
 	<li>The simple answer is because on-site renewable generation doesn’t work everywhere</li>
 	<li>Solar or wind resource varies from location to location – as do retail rates</li>
 	<li>Incentives, tariffs, rebates differ dramatically from location to location  and utility requirements differ too – a large multi-unit retailer may have dozens or even hundreds of utilities to work with</li>
 	<li>Leased locations or uncertainty about how long a location may make sense</li>
 	<li>Energy-intense facilities with not enough rooftop or adjacent land to cover full load</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Another reason is that offsite renewable energy projects are larger – tens or hundreds of MW
<ul>
 	<li>Allows a customer to purchase RE at scale – one project could cover all the load in a particular market – or the entire country</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>It’s important to note that an offsite RE purchase in the wholesale market doesn’t flow directly to your meter or cut out your regulated utility – they still have the monopoly to serve your load inside their franchise. And in deregulated retail markets your selected retail provider will still serve your load, but can price the wholesale RE purchase into your monthly bills.</li>
 	<li>Regardless whether you’re in a regulated or deregulated retail market (or a mix) – a wholesale RE purchase creates a hedge against wholesale energy costs – and since retail rates are partially driven by wholesale costs – a hedge against your retail rates, albeit, not a perfect hedge.
<ul>
 	<li>similar to hedges you may use in your business to hedge other commodities like fuel or agricultural products</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Do I get to claim the environmental benefits if it’s not located onsite?</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Absolutely! Offsite RE projects generate Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) and those RECs and other present or future environmental attributes can convey to the buyer of the electricity – “bundled”, (or “unbundled” to a third party who purchases just the RECs and not the underlying energy)</li>
 	<li>The RE purchase can also include the “marketing rights” – the exclusive right to market or advertise the RE purchase so there is no confusion or competing claim on the RE attributes</li>
 	<li>RECs are generated by registration in state compliance programs (e.g. Maryland RPS), or by certification with an NGO like the Green-e certification from the Center for Resource Solutions.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>
<ul>
 	<li>RECs from state compliance programs are usually created, tracked, traded, and retired in a web platform offering transparency for participating parties
<ul>
 	<li>Example: ERCOT, PJM-GATS</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>RECs from a voluntary registration program (e.g. Green-e) are usually created, tracked, and reported with paper forms and compliance attestations</li>
 	<li>Either way, the purchaser of the REC can claim all the RE attributes and use those credits toward RE or emission reduction targets</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>What other benefits does an offsite project offer?</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>
<ul>
 	<li>Large impact – large scale – quickly meet RE goals</li>
 	<li>“Additionality” – agreement to purchase RE causes project to be built –changes the grid mix</li>
 	<li>Fewer projects/contracts to manage (1 offsite vs. dozens of onsite)</li>
 	<li>No capital investment – fixed price energy purchase</li>
 	<li>Hedge value (discussed before)</li>
 	<li>Positive NPV in many markets (wind and solar growing)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
Thank you, Drew, for sharing your insights and helping our audience better understand offsite. We’re excited for offsite 201 occurring next month where we will discuss why customers pursue offsite and strategies you can use to deploy it.

Well, it’s time to wrap up this month’s Solar Tea Time. If anyone would like to talk to REC Solar or Duke Energy Renewables more about going solar or offsite renewables, feel free to email us. You can also email us if you have questions that you would like answered in future Solar Tea Times.

On behalf of everyone at REC Solar, Cheers!",,,

Hello everyone. Welcome to Solar Tea Time. I’m Craig Noxon, Vice President of Enterprise Sales, and we have a very special guest expert for this month: Cal Poly’s Director of Energy, Utilities and Sustainability, Dennis Elliott.

So Dennis, Cal Poly just finished their 4.5-megawatt solar installation in beautiful San Luis, Obispo. It will power 25 percent of the campus’s energy and save Cal Poly more than $10 million over the next 20 years. That’s a pretty good story that we thought you all might be interested in learning more about and hearing tips firsthand from the team that brought it to fruition.

So before we get started, I will just do a little housekeeping. I wanted you all to be aware that your line is muted. But you can type questions inside the webcast under the “Questions” tab. We will try and get to answer those questions at the end of the webcast or if we run out of time, we will email you after the webcast.

OK. So that’s it for logistics. Hope everyone has a cup of tea and we will get started with tips from Cal Poly in going solar. So Dennis, welcome to Solar Tea Time.

Dennis Elliott: Good morning.

Craig Noxon: We appreciate you and Cal Poly joining us to discuss your recent solar project and sharing some hopefully gems of wisdom with people, that you embarked on this solar journey. So with that, we will get straight into the questions, Dennis.
<h4>What were the motivations that led Cal Poly to consider solar?</h4>
Dennis Elliott: There are a number of them. Cal Poly, as a member of the Cal State University System, is working within some system-wide energy and sustainability policies, which have been setting goals to motivate the campuses to develop these type of projects for many years, to increase onsite generation, energy independence, be good stewards of the environment and public tax dollars and student dollars, and to reduce our operating costs. So all those were very much in alignment with this particular project.

Craig Noxon: OK, that’s great.

<strong>How did Cal Poly decide to move forward with solar procurement?</strong>

Dennis Elliott: Well, this is not our first solar project. We participated in several rounds of solar project development that have been managed centrally either by the Cal State University or the California Department of General Services.

Those have been challenging for us in the past because our cost of electricity was so low. We happen to own our own substation and therefore pay power under a transmission level tariff. So our cost of electricity was fairly low and this opportunity really depended upon the solar industry becoming competitive enough to compete with that cost of energy.

Another driver for us was our president’s signing of the Second Nature Climate Commitment a couple of years ago, committing our campus to go beyond CSU climate policy, all the way to climate neutrality. So developing a large solar project was really key to our success to move the needle both on our operating costs and our carbon emission.

Craig Noxon: That’s interesting. So is this something that you have had in mind for a while and just kind of kept an eye on the solar industry until it got to the point that a project like this might make sense?

Dennis Elliott: Certainly. We’ve been watching the industry, watching costs, participating in previous realms of solicitation where we did not get a successful, viable project based really on price. We also knew that in the three different flavors of how to construct solar, rooftop versus covered parking shade, pursuing a large ground mount array would allow us to minimize the capital costs for unit of energy production and to build a much larger system that could take advantage of the economy of scale.

Craig Noxon: OK, great. So when you were doing this evaluation, I’m curious if you added any kind of specialist, your staff, to help you manage this energy procurement, what kind of roles they played.

<strong>What sort of team did you need to put together in order to manage this project?</strong>

Dennis Elliott: Sure, great question. So I manage a small team. Our little department with the facilities, known as Energy, Utilities, and Sustainability is a team of three.

Two of us are engineers by trade and by training. So we have some skillset in this space. We have a larger project management organization that handles major capital for new construction of new academic buildings, housing buildings, major renovations, and tenant improvements.

So we have an organization that is skilled at taking all types of construction projects from conception to completion and closeout. We have the ability to manage this type of construction projects internally, and the type of skills that we needed to bring to the table that were not in-house were really focused on on-track document development on the frontend, as well as some specialty inspection skills that we were able to contract for just out of the local market to do our due diligence during the construction process.

The majority of those costs were for inspection project oversight, which we were able to roll into the cost of the project since this is a power purchase agreement. We were able to set up the fee structures to cover those costs by requiring a payment from the selected developer at the frontend of the project, so that we will have capital to cover those costs – really minimizing the need for capital out of pocket.
<h4>So is that one of the ways that you help sell this project internally?</h4>
Dennis Elliott: Absolutely. The triple bottom line for sustainability always talks about the three Ps: people, planet, profit, or the three Es: environment, economy and every time we talk about these large projects, I’m always reminded by the folks that are in charge of the first strings, that these things need to pencil out financially. So we were very focused on that in developing this project and making proposals to our leadership to make use of roughly 20 acres of land for this purpose, and how to achieve maximum benefit out of it.

Craig Noxon: Yeah, that’s interesting.

<strong>How did you evaluate and compare the different vendors once you had the RFP down the street?</strong>

Dennis Elliott: It was really a combined RFQ-RFP: request for qualifications and request for proposals. It’s a standard process that we use when selecting consultants or contractors for designer construction tasks. Based on our experience and the CSU’s experience and that of our selected consultants to help us develop those documents, we established minimum criteria for the experience of the selected team, to ensure that they had designed and constructed successfully projects of this type and scale, had a track record of successful projects with similar institutional clients, and that they were financially healthy to make sure that we were entering into a long-term agreement with a firm that we could rely on.

Craig Noxon: And can you talk a little bit about what that meant internally, how you went about that approach of selecting them? I think you kind of created your own calculator. Is that right?

Dennis Elliott: Yeah, for the selection process, once you have a qualified firm that you can rely on and know is going to be around for a long time, it really boils down to the dollars and cents. So in order to evaluate the different vendor proposals on an apples to apples basis, at the advice of our consultants, we developed a simple Excel spreadsheet calculator that could take vendor proposals and quantify the system size, and estimate its energy performance on an hour by hour and monthly basis. So then we could populate this calculator with the value of the energy generated at each hour of the day, each month of the year, to quantify the financial value of what each proposed design would produce.

Then there were some contractual elements built into our documents to ensure with performance guarantees that those would be met. Ultimately, our calculator would compute what is called the “net present value” of the cash flow of the 20-year project, so that we could evaluate the price proposal given to us on an apples to apples basis. Some vendors might propose a larger size than another. Some might generate more energy than another and we wanted to give the marketplace flexibility to design the system that best fit each developer’s skillset, experience and financial drivers because each might have a different set of financial criteria that drove their cost of funds for the project.

<strong>What other factors beyond price mattered to Cal Poly?</strong>

Dennis Elliott: Well certainly qualifications, the ability to deliver similar projects. But it was a very interesting opportunity for us to think about academic applications of this system and so I reached out to colleagues in the College of Engineering prior to development of the contract documents and I asked some folks that I know. If you have an opportunity to influence the way facilities went about this project to make it more useful for you and the classroom and the laboratory, what do you wish would be included? I had feedback from electrical engineering faculty with a laundry list of metering, telemetry, weather station, so that they would have access to performance data to inform problem assignments, class assignments, lab experimentation to do design and modeling of systems and then compare those designs or those models to actual performance data from the solar farm.

So we included in our contract specifications a wealth of metering, monitoring and telemetry to create a performance database with a dashboard interface, so that interested faculty and students could query that database to collect their own data sets without relying on us to produce them manually. That database would be very granular with hopefully all the data that somebody might think they need in the future and the ability to serve it up to themselves.

Craig Noxon: Yeah. So the Cal Poly case seems interesting to me because it appears you really integrated the solar array into your core mission, which I believe is learned by doing.

<strong>How is that solar farm integrated into Cal Poly’s core mission?</strong>

Dennis Elliott: It’s something that’s very near and dear to my heart as a Cal Poly graduate. I’m a graduate of the Mechanical Engineering Program. I’ve had the opportunity to teach a couple of times in that program and so I was very attuned to what could possibly be done in envisioning this solar farm to support that. So absolutely, Cal Poly’s motto and pedagogy is hands-on learn by doing and as a graduate, I experienced that firsthand.

The amount of time you spend in the laboratory in small classroom settings of roughly 24 students where you are being taught face-to-face by a Ph.D. professor rather than a graduate student, those are some of the things that make a Cal Poly education special. So the opportunity to fine-tune an important facility’s project to support the academic mission was very exciting for me, and making a system like this available and relevant to the classroom for not just electrical engineering but a wide variety of programs. You can imagine the disciplines that might be interested in either the technology or the financial aspects of the environment aspects of a solar farm of this scale.

So we worked with faculty partners that we have met through providing tours to classes that were interested in seeing a particular building or system or sharing energy data about our utility systems because Cal Poly is essentially a small city that manages electricity, natural gas, water, sewer, just like a city does. It has all those infrastructure systems to design, construct, maintain and manage all the time.

That we have incredible assets that are very relevant to the classroom and the lab. So thinking through those intentionally and strategically on the frontend to serve that need was an interesting challenge to me and I’m very proud of what it’s going to be able to do and it’s not just going to be a benefit to the Electrical Engineering Program. That’s where we’re starting as the most obvious point of connection. But I have great hope that it’s going to be relevant to many more programs than that.

<strong>Can you tell us more about how you’re integrating with sheep around the solar installation itself?</strong>

Dennis Elliott: Sure, thank you. There’s really two different applications academically that we’re focusing on. As you mentioned, the sheep connection. So in preparing for this project, we went through a very robust due diligence process to review potential sites to build a solar farm of this scale on.

We were really targeting roughly a five-megawatt system that is an aspect of the utility turf that we are using, RES-BCT, which stands for Renewable Energy Self-Generation Bill Credit Transfer. That is a utility program that is available to local governments and that the CSU campus qualifies, cities and counties would qualify.

That tariff allowed us to build a system that number one, could be up to five megawatts in size and number two, didn’t necessarily have to be behind our customer meter. It opened up a world of possibilities that could be developed offsite, either on our own land, which Cal Poly is a significant landholder, or on somebody else’s land, under some kind of lease agreement.

So within that framework, we evaluated a lot of sites. We evaluated 11 different potential sites, most of them on campus land, and a couple of privately-owned. The particular site that we arrived on as ideal was a 20-acre parcel of sheep pasture that was used by Cal Poly’s Animal Science Program and Sheep Unit for grazing land for the sheep herd, as part of an academic program.

Certainly in developing a solar farm that takes up a significant footprint on the sheep pasture, we wanted to think through the potential impacts on that program and potential opportunities to collaborate with them.

In the utility world where large multi-hundred megawatts solar farms are being developed in California and elsewhere, the environment impact in the land used is a significant challenge and opportunity there. Vegetation management is a key part of operating and maintaining a solar farm of this scale.

So immediately the opportunity was evident in front of us. We have an active sheep unit, sheep grazing pasture. From all the other design criteria of siting, constructability, shading, proximity to utility infrastructure, for interconnection, the sheep unit pasture was the ideal site of all those that we evaluated.

The ability to build the solar farm in such a manner that it could still be used as grazing land to provide feed for the sheep herd and in addition provide new academic opportunities for research around both site management practices for storm water control, erosion control, but more specifically how to perform vegetation management on the utility scale solar farm using sheep as a method with really the lowest environmental footprint possible.

That was an opportunity that in the conversation with our animal science and college agriculture partners was a big part of the sales pitch. We want to disrupt your operation for a few months to build this solar farm. But when it’s done, we want to bring your herd back onto this land to continue grazing and provide some additional academic opportunities for hands-on learn by doing and applied research.

<strong>How else have you managed this process without overloading your own staff?</strong>

Dennis Elliott: Well, back to the concept of how we are financing the entire project as a power purchase agreement, for listeners that might not be familiar with that, what that means is our contract documents were looking for a qualified solar developer that also had the ability to finance a project like this.

What that means is we don’t actually own the solar equipment. It’s owned by REC Solar under a 20-year agreement in which we’ve agreed to essentially lease the land that it sits on for zero dollars and in return, we’ve executed a 20-year agreement over what Cal Poly will pay for the energy that that system generates.

The RES-BCT tariff that I mentioned earlier makes that more attractive and that we get to pick the tariff at our point of generation and that establishes the dollar value of the energy generated and on the backend, we have a power purchase agreement with REC that ensures that REC has adequate cash flow to cover the cost of the material, the design, the construction, the maintenance and provides an adequate return on investment for its financier.

Within that, there were tasks that Cal Poly had to perform as the owner of the site and the owner of the power purchase agreement. So things like developing the contract documents, providing project management oversight, construction inspection, testing those kind of things.

We could budget in advance having familiarity with other large capital projects, so what those expenses would be, and just build into the language of the RFQ/RFP a requirement of an upfront payment of those dollars from the selected developer to make sure we had adequate cash in hand to perform the services that we needed to as part of the project implementation process.

Craig Noxon: That’s great. Well, thanks Dennis. Thanks for your time. That wraps up the time we have today. So I just wanted to extend my thanks and appreciation to you and the Cal Poly team for being a great partner not only on this podcast but as a customer of REC.

So enjoy tomorrow’s Valentine’s Day. I hope everyone appreciates that and if anyone would like to talk to REC Solar or Cal Poly about going solar, please feel free to email us and you can also email in if you have any questions that we weren’t able to get to today.

So on behalf of everyone in REC, thanks Dennis.

Dennis Elliott: Sure, thank you.

<strong>Hello everyone and welcome to Solar Tea Time!</strong>

I’m Craig Noxon, VP of Enterprise Sales at REC Solar and we have our REC Solar Manager of Monitoring, Craig Merrilees, as our guest expert this month. Welcome Craig!

Thanks namesake, It’s my pleasure to be on.

<strong>It is good to have another Craig on the call, I truly appreciate you being here.</strong>

Before we get started, a little housekeeping. I wanted you to all be aware that your line is muted but you can type questions inside of the webcast under the questions tab. We will try to answer questions at the end of the webcast or we will get back to you via email. OK, that’s it for the logistics. Let’s get to the topic of the day, Solar Data Monitoring!

Understanding solar monitoring is crucially important for anyone managing a solar system. It can save you a lot of money and a lot of grief. So, without further ado, let’s share the splendors of data monitoring with our audience. First question:
<h3>What is Solar Data monitoring?</h3>
At its most basic level, it’s all about gathering data from various devices at a solar installation and saving that information to a database in the cloud. We collect data from revenue grade meters, the inverters, and we gather information on the amount of our sun’s energy either from on-site sensors or satellite observations. In the database we typically record all this information in 5-minute intervals.
<h3>So first step is to gather the data, I get it. Before we go further how do we do that?</h3>
We have industrial computers that we install onsite called data loggers that query the devices and send that info to the cloud. It’s all part of the monitoring package that gets installed along with the inverters, meters, and modules. REC Solar partners with a renewable energy monitoring company that provides us the hardware and the use of their cloud based database and web servers. The end user, either in the form of an REC Solar service associate or an REC Solar customer, gets a login and can access the 5-minute data. There are reports that can be setup to send automatically on production, and alarms and alerts that are configured to tell us if something goes awry.
<h3>And what if the data logger Internet connection is down?</h3>
Good point, well actually in that case, the data logger is designed to cache data locally. It continues to read data from all the inverters and meters. Then it will send that data up to the cloud when the Internet connection is up again.
<h3>How long can the data logger keep info without the need to send it to the cloud?</h3>
Ah computer memory is plentiful these days. We can easily store a month or more of data on the data logger before it’s needed to be sent on its way. And in a worst-case scenario, if the connection can’t be fixed in an acceptable amount of time, we can get the data via the old school sneaker net method. You know, when you walk up to the computer in your sneakers and get the data off it manually. Then we would upload it to the cloud.
<h3>Now that we have all this data in the cloud – what do we do with it and how can it help a customer?</h3>
The data is the “tell-all” for knowing if the system is producing as it should. We know for example, that given a certain amount of the sun’s energy falling on the array, a certain amount of energy should be flowing out of the inverters. It’s called a performance test and it works a bit like this. At solar noon it’s typical that the sun will provide us 1,000 watts per square meter of power, reaching the Earths’ surface. This is on a clear blue-sky day mind you. A module itself might be rated for 300Watts at 25 degrees Celsius. Let’s say you had 3,000 of those modules making up an installation with a DC capacity of 900,000 watts or 900Kilowatts. Well… There’s one more piece we need before we can actually predict what energy will flow from the system. We need to take into account any losses that occur between the modules and the point where the electricity gets placed in to the facility. There are losses in the DC conductors, the inverters, and AC conductors. Typically, this represents a number of around 10%… and in monitoring circles is referred to as the de-rate. To continue with our example, if we had that 1,000 Watts per square meter of sun energy falling on our 900 kiloWatt solar system at 25°cell temperature, then we would expect the 10% decrease of the 900kW DC to results in 810kiloWatts of power being fed into the facility. If the sun is lower in the sky providing us with less power, say only 500 watts per square meter, then we’d adjust down our prediction by 1/2.

There are a variety of ways this performance test can give insights into the health of the solar installation. If we score this by taking the actual energy over the expected energy we can get a performance index. 100% being ideal. If this number gradually goes down over the course of a couple of weeks or months, it’s a good indication that we have a soiling issue. Speaking of soiling, looking at the performance index score over time, if you see an uptick in performance around the time of a big rainstorm, then you know your modules where cleaned for you by mother nature. It’s also true that if you get a small amount of rain that washes the dust down to the bottom portion of the module it can actually make production worse. You’d see that in the data too.

<strong>Yes, I know clean modules play an important role in the performance of an installation. And now I understand that monitoring can help me decide when to clean. On to our next question.</strong>
<h3>What is the latest in data monitoring technology and how does IoT come into play?</h3>
Wow Craig, IoT, Internet of Things. Busting out with these tech-head acronyms on me are you? Well let’s see. You could consider the Inverters at a solar installation like a smart appliance you might have at home. But instead of your dryer letting you know when your clothes are dry or your refrigerator telling you it’s time to buy more milk for Solar tea time… Your inverter tells you if there’s an issue with your solar energy generation system. The inverters can detect utility grid disturbances, and /or report on faults that might arise.

<strong>Great, so that means I get to maximize my investment in my solar by knowing if it is producing as it should be.</strong>

You got it. There’s another side to this Craig. You see, there are some compliances that need to be adhered to that are mandated by the various utilities. It’s outlined in UL 1741. It started off with a safety feature that when utility power was removed from a solar installation, that that site would stop producing electricity. The idea here is if utility workers are working on the transmission lines, we want to make sure there is no foreign source of electricity on the lines from Solar generation facilities that could pose a danger to the workers.
<h3>How would an inverter know if the utility grid went away? I mean if there are many inverters all on site producing electricity, how can the inverter tell the difference from neighboring inverter’s electricity vs the utility electricity.</h3>
Ah, great catch there Craig. There are a variety of ways that this is accomplished, but here’s just one as an example… it’s called frequency pushing. In North America the electricity that we get from the utilities is AC, meaning alternating current at 60 hertz. Essentially what this means is the voltage of your electricity is moving from positive to negative 60 times per second.

<strong>Yeah, I get we’re 60 hertz and Europe uses 50 hertz, so how does that help the utility worker?</strong>

Well, imaging if all the inverters were trying to make the frequency just a little bit faster, always. But you have this big national utility grid out there that is not movable. All the gas and coal and nuclear generators spinning at a set frequency resisting the change. All of the inverters are trying to push this thing faster. Now imagining if the grid goes away, all of the sudden the inverters DO push the frequency faster than 60 hertz. Now the rules of UL 1741 come in to play. They state the inverters can only run within a certain frequency range. The inverters exceed that tolerance and shut down.
<h3>What does this have to do with data monitoring?</h3>
It’s more than just data monitoring. It’s about the network. The whole IOT thing. These inverters can get new programming remotely now. It’s like Tesla pushing out updates to their cars with over-the-air programming. This is huge, in the past we would’ve sent a field tech to the site to visit each and every inverter, connect a laptop and upload an update , you know, to change the programming for an inverter., but now with the advent of IOT, they can be reprogrammed remotely. So as the compliance rules change, so can the programming of the inverters. It’s the network that is at the core of this ability. Take Hawaii for an example. With the huge percentage of Solar compared to the rest of the generating sources, the implementation of UL 1741 supplement A is being required. Supplement A adds all kinds of beneficial rules, this time not just to protect the utility worker if the grid goes away, but now the inverters can SUPPORT the grid during times of brownouts and sags. We are creating a more reliable grid by adding renewable generation. This inverter magic can now happen thanks to the reprogramming made possible by the same IOT technology that allows you to turn your lights on at home from your smart phone while watching your dog play at the dog park.

<strong>I get it. The data monitoring and the inverter remote updates have a common theme of the underlying network.
OK, well that’s a good transition to this question…</strong>
<h3>What should I consider when choosing how to network my solar system?</h3>
Well… you need to know what level of reliability and performance you require at the solar installation. If we’re talking about just reporting meter and inverter data up to the cloud, then a caching data logger with a cell modem is sufficient. But… if we’re talking a site where the utility requires the remote control of the inverters. And let’s say those inverters need to respond to the control signals within a second or two? Then we’ll need to consider a dedicated land based Internet connection with possible redundant fiber optic rings at the site. It really depends on the need at hand.

There are basically two types of networks that can exists at an installation. There’s the tried and true RS-485 industrial serial network which is slow but reliable and great for long distances. Perfect for getting data from an inverter a thousand feet away. Just make sure to use the proper RS-485 cable and use terminating resistors at the ends of long runs to prevent signal reflection. RS-485 devices need to be wired in a daisy chain fashion with a maximum length of 4000 feet, but never in a star configuration. Then we have the more modern TCP IP network which is what the Internet works on. It does get wired in a star configuration and with Ethernet switches can go 300 feet in length, or with fiber can go miles. We also utilize wireless point to point and mesh networks when it makes sense to.
<h3>Here’s another question for you, Why is testing important and what’s in it for me?</h3>
Testing is core for us here at REC. We do monitoring testing during initial site commissioning to verify the network performance, and to check the quality of the data from the various devices. We make sure the data from the revenue grade meter… matches what the inverters say. If we have onsite weather sensors, we make sure they’re calibrated, and match hand held instruments we use during the commissioning process. We gather data via the monitoring system and score the solar installation based on a few days of production. Once we get approval from the utility and we’re confident that the system is producing as expected, we Cristen the site as ready for production. Once the PV system is up and running, the energy data as recorded in the revenue grade meter, at times, can be used for SREC credits and rebates with certain utilities.

We also want to make sure any shading has been properly dealt with if any exists on-site. During the testing stage we look at the array to see any shading that occurs during the day. It’s important for the shade to be limited to as few strings as possible. For optimized production, we’d rather see 50% of one string be shaded rather than 25 % of two strings. It’s just how the modules react to shade, a little bit of shade has a big negative impact on the production of the string.
<h3>But isn’t it true that systems designed with optimizers or micro-inverters are immune to this string shading issue?</h3>
Yes, that is absolutely the case. And for shade prone installations, REC uses optimizers and microinverters for maximizing site output. If you look at monitoring data in play-back mode for a microinverter installation you can pretty much see clouds go over the array as the different modules get shaded and produce less. It’s a pretty cool sight. Speaking of clouds, weather is one of the largest contributing factors to Solar performance. Some years just have more solar irradiance than others and it’s a very localized phenomenon. We use visible spectrum Satellite data which has been enhanced with infrared imagery to improve the accuracy of the Satellite data. It has to do with the satellite being able to tell the difference between say snow and clouds. Visibly hard to do, but in the infrared spectrum, doable.
<h3>How does the Satellite data help the customer?</h3>
We use the Satellite data coupled with the monthly production model to see if the site is producing compared to the original engineers’ modeled production. It’s just another benchmark we use to see how a site is doing. Basically, we know what a site should produce for a month given certain predicted weather conditions. We adjust this expected amount by the difference in predicted weather vs actual weather as seen from the Satellite. Again, a score of 100% is ideal. Another method we use that is quite powerful is the inverter heat map analysis. This works great on sites with multiple inverters or optimizers where you can compare the output of all to each. The “heat map” color coding provides an effective visual way to see the high and low performers.
<h3>Why do I want all this data?</h3>
It all boils down to generating the most energy. To do this we need to identify losses. If it’s soiling, shading, inclement weather, or equipment issues, we want to understand what impacts our installations. By analyzing monitoring data, and doing various performance tests and inverter comparisons, we can maximize the energy by learning if there are production shortfalls, and what is responsible for them. That… and it makes for a great activity while sipping a glass of solar tea.

Thank you, Craig, for sharing your years of insights on how customer can leverage data monitoring to their benefit. We are out of time for this month’s Solar Tea Time.

Hello everyone and welcome to Solar Tea Time!

I’m Craig Noxon, VP of Enterprise Sales and we have a very special guest expert for this month, Green Charge’s Director of Market Development and Policy, Juliana Mandell. Our Solar Tea Time today is like a calming chamomile tea, we’re going to allay your worries and discuss what utility policy discussions are out there and how solar + storage might help.

Before we get started, a little housekeeping. I wanted you to all be aware that your line is muted but you can type questions inside of the webcast under the questions tab. We will try to answer questions at the end of the webcast or we will get back to you via email. OK, that’s it for the logistics. Let’s get to the topic of the day, solar + storage.

Juliana, welcome to Solar Tea Time. We appreciate you and Green Charge joining us to discuss upcoming utility policy changes that people are getting wind of. We are curious what you think might be coming down the pike and how solar and storage can help. With that, let’s get to the questions:
<h4>How &amp; why are utilities looking to restructure how they charge for energy?</h4>
In many ways the trend in utilities looking to restructure how they charge for energy is actually a result of the success of the solar industry across the country. We’ve seen a tremendous uptick in solar installations and of the percentage of our grid electricity now coming solar. This is especially true for clean energy state leaders, like California, with progressive policies promoting solar adoption.

All of this solar generation has led to what grid experts refer to as the “duck curve” in terms of load consumption. Traditionally, electricity demand is at its highest in the middle of the day driving up prices. However, in states like California, so much solar electricity is now being produced in the middle of the day that we see wholesale electricity prices going very low and at times even negative. This trend has shifted peak electricity demand into the evening. In California this trend is so pronounced folks have nicknamed the duck curve “duckzilla”.

Utilities buy electricity at wholesale prices and then sell it to consumers as retail. They want to align their costs by moving peak pricing for consumers into the evening to better reflect when electricity is now actually at its most expensive. In California, regulators have pushed for this change and it has come in the form of restructuring Time Of Use rates. Time of Use rates are shifting the peak hours, when electricity is most expensive from the day into the evening.  Instead of paying the highest price for electricity in the middle of the day, it will now be electricity consumption in the evening that will be most expensive.
<h4>When are these changes coming?</h4>
In California, San Diego Gas and Electric has already received approval to shift their peak Time of Use rate hours from 11AM – 5 PM to 4 PM – 9 PM. SDG&amp;E should release its final rates with these new Time of Use rates going into effect in the next month or two. SCE and PG&amp;E are expected to go live with these Time of Use rates Q2 or Q3 of 2018.

California is the first state to implement these kinds of changes, but other states will need to address similar problems soon. Especially when we look out at RPS targets and other solar industry growth projects in these states. We see that other states aim to achieve similar levels of solar penetration on their gird as present-day California. We also see related conversations about trying to better align wholesale costs with retail rates happening in New York as part of the state’s “Reforming the Energy Vision” or “REV” process.  Over the last few years New York has embarked on an ambitious plan to overhaul how their grid works in an effort to make it more clean and resilient while lowering costs. A lot of the big changes are still in the planning stage, but we see movement towards greater transparency to wholesale rates with more dynamic pricing, including incorporating the locational value of energy into the valuation process.

I think greater transparency to wholesale markets and alignment of retail rates to wholesale market dynamics is a trend we should expect to continue to play out across the country over the next few years.
<h4>What does this mean for ratepayers looking to install solar across the US?</h4>
In states that do adopt these kinds of changes, it can make the value proposition for rooftop solar more complicated. Solar continues to produce electricity in the middle of the day, but now rates will be highest in the evening. As a non-flexible resource, this misalignment can hurt the economics of a project, especially if a commercial entity continues to consume load in the evening. However, solar when combined with storage can help address a lot of these problems.
<h4>How does storage come into play?</h4>
Storage, when paired with solar, has the ability to transform solar into a flexible resource. Solar energy generated during the day can now be consumed in the evening. Storage can store solar produced during the day and discharge that electricity in the evening to help customers avoid charges during the new evening peak pricing.

Additionally, solar and storage can work together to lower complimentary aspects of a consumer’s utility bill. While solar reduces the energy consumption on a utility bill (kWh), <a href=""https://sustainablesolutions-duke-energy-com-staging.go-vip.net/solutions/distributed-generation/energy-storage/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">storage</a> can help reduce demand charges and other power costs (kW). We’ve seen instances, in areas with high demand charges, where demand charges make up 50% or more of a customer’s utility bill.  Intelligent energy storage software can operate a storage system such that it predicts a site’s peak loads and discharges during those times to reduce demand charge costs, we call this “peak shaving.”

Through load shifting, peak shaving, and additional opportunities to participate in Demand Response and other utility programs the value proposition for solar and storage is beginning to look very attractive in certain markets.
<h4>Can you talk about how public policy impacts the economics of solar + storage?</h4>
There are a lot of exciting synergies in public policy between solar and storage that consumers can take advantage of at the moment. One of the biggest is the federal solar investment tax credit. When a storage system is built with solar it can also take advantage of the tax credit and reduce costs by 30%. In California there is also the SGIP program, which currently provides a significant incentive to install behind-the-meter storage. Between the ITC and SGIP, in California you can reduce the cost of a storage system by about 50%.

However, it is important to note that both of these incentives are expected to step down and be phased out over the next few years. They are intended to jump start the market, not stick around indefinitely.  While we expect storage system costs to continue to decline, that decline may not be as significant as the current available incentives. That’s why I’d encourage those considering energy storage in California to look into the opportunity now before the incentives run out.
<h4>You talked about California.  Where else can storage make sense?</h4>
California is often a first mover in progressive energy policy and is a good bellwether for where the rest of the states are going. We see a number of states watching California and a few with progressive policies for storage coming out soon. We are pretty excited about Massachusetts. The state has traditionally been a clean energy leader and we see that in how they are looking at storage too. The upcoming SMART program – set for Q2 2018- is a successor to SREC II and creates an attractive incentive program for commercial solar and storage. I mentioned the New York REV process, that is a little further from implementation, but still exciting. We are also interested in Hawaii, especially as a kind of laboratory for the future given the rollback of NEM and high prices for electricity on the island grid.
<h4>What is needed to understand if storage makes sense for a customer?</h4>
<strong>First</strong> is location.  Being located in an area with attractive incentives like California or Massachusetts makes a big difference.
<strong>Second</strong> is utility bill structure. Storage can provide the most value for customers with high demand charges and TOU rates, especially if those TOU rates are shifting to the evening. We generally look for demand charges at $15/ kW or higher.
<strong>Third</strong> is energy consumption patterns. Energy storage can provide the most value to customers with “peaky” load consumption patterns. By this I mean spikes in electricity usage, rather than very flat energy usage. If you are unsure of your energy usage patterns an energy storage company can help you read the 15-minute interval data from your utility.  In order to do this having a smart meter is very helpful.

Thank you, Juliana, for sharing your insights and helping us better understand what changes might be down the pike and how solar + storage can help.

Well, it’s time to wrap up this month’s Solar Tea Time and to probably get another cup of my pumpkin spice tea.

If anyone would like to talk to REC Solar or Green Charge more about solar + storage, feel free to email us. You can also email us if you have questions that you would like answered in future Solar Tea Times.

On behalf of everyone at REC Solar, Cheers!",,,

Hello everyone and welcome to Solar Tea Time!

I’m Craig Noxon, VP of Enterprise Sales at REC Solar and we have our REC Solar Director of Operations, Billy Heidt, as our guest expert this month. Welcome Billy!

Before we get started, a little housekeeping. I wanted you to all be aware that your line is muted but you can type questions inside of the webcast under the questions tab. We will try to answer questions at the end of the webcast or we will get back to you via email. OK, that’s it for the logistics. Let’s get to the topic of the day, Solar maintenance pitfalls to avoid.

Billy, in your years in the solar industry, I’m guessing you have seen a lot and have all sorts of advice to share with our fine listeners. So, let’s start sharing that knowledge!
<h3>Here is the first question for you. Why do people do operations and maintenance?</h3>
In its simplest form, operations and maintenance is performed to ensure systems are continually running and are cared for so they will last 20-30 years.
<h3>What operations and maintenance should be performed on a system?</h3>
The maintenance that should be performed is highly dependent on the system and the local environment. At a minimum, I recommend making sure the system has a good data acquisition system setup with properly configured alarms. Secondly, make sure someone is dedicated to receiving those alarms and knows what they mean and what to do about them.

In terms of preventative maintenance, all of the maintenance requirements of the installed equipment such as inverters and trackers must be completed with proper records kept for all of the work.

This is especially important with any field deployed electronics, such as inverters and anything with moving parts such as trackers which incorporate actuators and drive motors.

<strong>Is the monitoring system something that is built into my solar installation?</strong>

Almost every <a href=""https://sustainablesolutions-duke-energy-com-staging.go-vip.net/solutions/distributed-generation/solar-energy/"">solar integrator</a> should be including a monitoring system. What is normally not included in the build is someone utilizing the monitoring system in real time to watch for any performance issues that may arise.
<h3>How should businesses weigh whether to maintain the system themselves or enter into a service contract with an O&amp;M provider?</h3>
You should know what needs to be done and understand if your company or facility has the expertise and bandwidth to cover it. For instance, many farmers will wash arrays themselves. Facilities with <a href=""https://sustainablesolutions-duke-energy-com-staging.go-vip.net/services/operations-maintenance/"">dedicated facility maintenance staff</a> can apply these resources to the system. These can be very effective cost savings approaches. What does not work well is ignoring the system after it is built.
<h3>What are the risks and potential issues with an O&amp;M agreement? What isn’t covered?</h3>
One thing to understand and separate in O&amp;M agreements is what is being offered and where risk inherently lies.

A basic O&amp;M agreement usually covers system monitoring, basic equipment maintenance, and additional services like washing and vegetation control.

Additional value adds such as IV curve tracing, which can catch accelerated module degradation, and Infrared scanning, which can catch critical components before they fail are often added.

Then you look at risk items. The biggest risk item is inverter failure, and a subsequent delayed or inadequate response from the manufacturers.

These items are not usually covered under agreements, although they are sometimes offered. When these things are offered, it is important to understand how they are accounting for it, how reliable these guarantees are, and what their relationships are with their manufacturers.
<h3>What are the most critical factors for maximizing system success over time?</h3>
Maximizing the most effective system over time actually begins during the development stage, long before a project is built. In the development stage, you want to make sure that the true operational budget is accounting for the life of the project.

For example, a system deployed in a place with sparse rainfall such as Central California and agricultural areas near where walnuts are grown will need to ensure system washing is planned for after trees are “shaken” to remove the copious amounts of debris that get on the panels.

Conversely, if a ground mount or tracker system is being deployed in central Florida, lack of rainfall is much less of a problem. In that environment annual system washings are likely not needed but you must make sure the vegetation plan is accounted for in both the project build and operation phase.

It would also be prudent to assume, over the life of a 20 to 30 year system there will need to be an inverter upgrade within the lifespan of the system. Most inverter manufacturers provide 5 or 10-year warranties. I would be skeptical of manufacturers who claim they offer longer than 10-year warranties.

To summarize, I would recommend 3 things as a rule of thumb. First, make sure the system is watched continually so any unforeseen issues should they come up, so these can be quickly addressed and resolved. Second, make sure all of the basic planned maintenance is lined up and scheduled within the first 3 months of operation. Third, make sure there is both a budget and a plan in place for expected activities such as washing, vegetation control, and periodic equipment refurbishments.

Thank you, Billy, for sharing your years of advice and really being honest about what people need to focus on for O&amp;M. Now, if you can just help me with all the deferred maintenance on my house! We are out of time for this month’s Solar Tea Time. If anyone would like to talk to Billy, feel free to email us. You can also email us if you have questions that you would like answered in future Solar Tea Times.",,,

<strong>Craig Noxon:</strong> Hello everyone. Welcome to Solar Tea Time. I’m Craig Noxon. I’m VP of Enterprise Sales at REC Solar and we have a very special guest expert for this month. It’s <a href=""http://www.schneider-electric.us/en/"">Schneider Electric</a>’s senior director of North American Microgrid Competency Center, Philip Barton. Welcome Philip.

REC Solar and Schneider have worked together on several solar plus microgrid projects and we thought that we would share some of the answers to questions that we frequently get and also hopefully give you some insights around microgrids.

Philip Barton, on behalf of REC, we welcome you and Schneider Electric to Solar Tea Time.

<strong>Philip Barton:</strong> Thanks Craig. But before you get started, I just want to thank you and the whole REC team for suggesting this. It’s a great idea and it has been fun preparing for it with you guys. So thanks again for the invitation.

<strong>Craig:</strong> Yeah, no worries. Philip, the first part of this question is,
<h4>“What is a microgrid?”</h4>
<strong>Philip:</strong> A microgrid is really a collection of distributed energy sources. Think solar photovoltaic, generator sets, maybe battery energy storage systems all working together, which can island or separate from the grid or maybe even, electrically speaking, be a true island.

There are others in the industry that say that islanding is not necessary and that a microgrid is really an organized set of sources and a set of loads operating within a definable, electrical boundary. But it’s also fair to say that a microgrid is a new word for something we’ve all been doing for a long time.

Maybe the reason there’s so much buzz around this word, this “microgrid” word, is that microgrids and solar go so well together. They actually need each other from our point of view and I think if you said “What’s just the one reason why”, it would be that solar photovoltaic systems are forced to turn off when utility grids shut down due to utility outage.

In a way, microgrids really unleash the solar and other inverter-based generation resources when they are needed the most. Microgrids allow these distributed energy resources to work with and without the grid. This is important because the US grid is made up of over 10 percent of distributed generation. Solar is the fastest-growing part of this by far, making the idea of making solar work without the grid is very important.

<strong>Craig:</strong> Philip, I just wanted to touch on a point you just brought up and that is that a lot of people don’t know. Solar needs to shut down during a blackout. People often think that if they have solar, they have an additional resource and they will be fine in a blackout if the sun keeps shining. But that’s not true and the reason for that is twofold. Technically the first reason is that solar requires a voltage source to synchronize with the grid and the second reason is really one about safety.

If you think about it, if there’s a blackout, then utility crews need to be working down the line and if all of a sudden there’s a current in solar, that is making those wires live, there could be injuries to safety workers. So those are the two reasons why solar needs to shut down.

<strong>Craig:</strong> But can you tell our audience a little bit.
<h4>How microgrids help make solar work when they are required to turn off during an outage?</h4>
<strong>Philip:</strong> Sure, Craig. Like you said, the law really or UL 1741 is that part of the code that requires the inverters to turn off when the grid turns off. But UL 1741 only applies when the main breakers and switches that connect to the site, the end user, the customer to the utility are on or where there’s continuity through those breakers and switches.

As soon as you open the main breakers and open the main switches, then you’re free to use your distributed energy resources including your solar however you would like to.

What we do in a microgrid is we send a signal to the inverter and to the generators and we tell them that instead of looking to the utility for the voltage source, look at the anchor resource, which could be a rotating machine, like an engine genset or generators. It could be of course multiple rotating machines. It could be something like a battery energy storage system.

But look at this anchor resource and use that as your reference voltage and that’s basically how these microgrids work.

<strong>Craig:</strong> You kind of described to me examples of an anchor resource.
<h4>Can you just more fully explain what you mean by anchor resource?</h4>
<strong>Philip:</strong> Yeah. It’s that whole idea that the grid is really the anchor resource. When you’re grid connected, when the microgrids are connected, the grid is the anchor resource and the solar inverters are very precisely attached to that voltage resource and lock into that very stable 60-hertz frequency.

The anchor resource is really just an alternative resource in island mode like the gen set or the combined heat and power system or co-gen system or again battery <a href=""https://sustainablesolutions-duke-energy-com-staging.go-vip.net/solutions/distributed-generation/energy-storage/"">energy storage system</a>.

<strong>Craig:</strong> Solar with grid, fine. The grid is the anchor resource. If the grid goes away, you have to shut it off because you need a voltage source and safety. Basically, you’re solving those two problems in a microgrid. You’re solving new voltage source with anchor resource and you’re islanding off from the grid.

<strong>Philip:</strong> That’s right, Craig. That’s right. You’re not back-feeding the grid because you’ve separated from it and you can’t send it back – the grid is not set up for back-feeding all the time unless that’s done especially under a contract.

<strong>Craig:</strong> Tell me,
<h4>Why do a lot of organizations deploy microgrids?</h4>
<strong>Philip:</strong> I think it really all boils down to three things and we like to call it the triple play for the baseball fans out there. The triple play of resilience, cost avoidance and sustainability. So resiliency, reliability, cost avoidance or efficiency and again sustainability, greenhouse gas reduction, et cetera. Those are really the main reasons that anybody would put a microgrid in.

One example that we’ve worked on together that illustrates this really well is Montgomery County, Maryland. Montgomery County, Maryland is in the Washington DC area and there are two campuses there. It’s the largest county in Maryland. It’s a million people and a bedroom community for the capital and the two projects there, one of them is the public safety headquarters and the other one is a correctional facility. The public safety headquarters is quite interesting. They had resiliency problems both externally from the utility and also internally in some of their medium voltage or electrical distribution.

At the same time, they were deploying solar in many of their buildings and building clusters and campuses across this fairly large county in Maryland. They were leveraging sustainability and greenhouse gas reduction and they were saving money while they were doing it. But the missing part was the resiliency.

The investments they were making in solar weren’t really helping their resiliency. So what REC Solar, Schneider and Duke Energy working together were able to do was to use a new combined heat and power plant at each of the two facilities, plus some existing natural gas-fired generation as the anchor resource for the nice, shiny two-megawatt AC of solar carports that REC Solar is installing.

It’s really a great project that demonstrates the resiliency piece, the sustainability piece and of course the resiliency, sustainability and of course the cost savings because they could do all this at just a very small premium to what they were paying for their existing utility and get some electrical upgrades and things they really needed anyway in the PPA that we created together for them.

<strong>Craig:</strong> Can you give us some other examples,
<h4>Who might be a good candidate for a microgrid? What type of organization? Where are they located?</h4>
<strong>Philip:</strong> Yeah, I think it’s people that want resiliency. So certainly customers and businesses that already have solar but need resiliency, I think that’s one place to look. I think considering the hurricanes, we do have a lot of microgrid work related to storm hardening. We do a lot of microgrid work related to cyber security concerns and things like that.

Many companies, big box stores like the Home Depots and the Walmarts and the Lowe’s and then corporate campuses inclusive of data centers and laboratories and government facilities. We were talking about Montgomery County in Maryland and military bases. Command centers for cities, water treatment facilities and of course universities as well.

So in all those, we have this combination of resiliency needs, laboratories, serving the public and really just that need to run without the grid for extended periods of time.

The other thing we don’t always like talking about is that a lot of people see microgrids not just as storm-hardening and resiliency, but they also see microgrids as a hedge against things like cyber-attacks or even kinetic attacks on the macrogrid or other critical infrastructure.

<strong>Craig:</strong> A couple of years ago, Ted Koppel had a book called Lights Out and it talks about how there could be a terrorist attack on the US grid system and just how easy it would be to take the US grid system out for a long period of time. It’s certainly a kind of topic not only to mention the recent hurricanes that we’ve had in the US. It’s a good topic to talk about here when speaking about microgrids. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about some of the risks that might be out there when people deploy a microgrid.
<h4>What should people watch out for?</h4>
<strong>Philip:</strong> Yeah. It’s a good question. I think number one, you really want to work with a developer. Not just somebody that says they can do it, but somebody that has been doing it and is experienced with the different types of microgrids that may need to be deployed for a given enterprise.

I think also it might be tempting to go to a manufacturer or supplier of a certain type of distributed energy resource. You shouldn’t let the type of equipment that you’re contemplating dictate exactly who you team with. I think it’s better to team with the companies and partners or really work with a lot of different types of distributed generation. So you can speak to the different types of microgrids that will need to be constructed across the geography relative to the cost of power or the thermal load, the size of the project and the incentives and other factors that would dictate the ultimate size and shape of the microgrid.

Above all, you really want to work with somebody disciplined on the project development cycle so you don’t waste time and money trying to lay a good foundation for your program.

<strong>Craig:</strong> That leads me into my next question. We got a lot of interest in this topic, more so than any of the other Tea Times we’ve done in the past. A lot of questions that we got related to cost. When people talk about cost, I typically like to talk about cost avoidance or risk avoidance and so if I summarize a bit of what you’ve been saying, it seems that when customers have solar. They have generators. They have other systems. But maybe by putting them together, they’re able to create something greater than some of their parts, right? Creating business continuity or a triple play of risk mitigation, lower costs, and sustainability.
<h4>But can we talk about how companies are paying for microgrids? What kind of structures they have set up or Opex versus Capex approach.</h4>
<strong>Philip:</strong> You said it well. I think there are two different scenarios here. I think there’s a scenario where you’ve got an existing solar or existing backup generator or maybe even you’re in California and you have some energy storage that you put in place for purposes of demand reduction or utility cost reduction, peak shaving and what not.

You want to use the distributed energy resources that you have already and complement them with what you need to build the microgrid. That’s the most cost-effective way to do it and if you do it right, you can run for a long time without the grid with your existing solar and with the right anchor resource and the right proportion.

You can have a great project that’s far more valuable than some of its individual parts to your point there, Craig.

<strong>Craig:</strong> If you have more of a blank sheet of paper or your facility is growing in size, then you have the opportunity to really look at how you want to do this. Do you want to pay capital? Do you want to put the capital out for it or do you want to do an Opex model, like a solar PPA or a lease and what we might call energy as a service or microgrid? Even microgrid as a service. These are specialized PPAs typically and they’re very easy to justify geographically in the US east, the northeast in particular and of course California and US west where a lot of times the power is 13 to 20 cents per kilowatt hour.

It’s fairly easy. There’s not much extra cost to do a microgrid there or there might even be savings even with that resiliency piece. But in other areas of the country, <a href=""https://sustainablesolutions-duke-energy-com-staging.go-vip.net/solutions/distributed-generation/solar-energy/"">renewables or solar</a> might not pencil as well. But in those cases, a lot of times, the natural gas cost is very low and that’s where it has been nice to work with Duke Energy Renewables on– not just the solar – but also the combined heat and power or maybe biogas or digester gas type microgrids as well.

A lot of flexibility there, green field and brown field.

<strong>Craig:</strong> Philip, we’re just about out of time here. I think we might wrap it up and I just want to thank you and Schneider for getting into the details about microgrids.

<strong>Philip:</strong> Thank you Craig and thank you REC Solar.

<strong>Craig:</strong> OK. On behalf of everyone that’s in REC Solar and Schneider Electric, cheers. Have a good day. Bye.",,,

<strong>Craig:</strong> Hi everyone, welcome to Solar Tea Time. I’m Craig Noxon, VP of Enterprise Sales and today we have a special guest and that is our REC Solar CFO, Gary Morris. In this week’s Solar Tea Time, you’ll be listening directly to our beloved CFO, Gary, and getting some advice from the C-suite. Gary, welcome to Solar tea time. I hope you have a cup of something wonderful.

<strong>Craig:</strong> Gary, you’ve outlined seven different tips that people could use when pitching a project to a CFO. It’s exciting for us to hear directly from you and so let’s just jump into it. But before we do, our listeners are from different types of organizations; big, small, medium.
<h4>Can you calibrate us before we get started about how these seven tips might be applicable to different types of organizations?</h4>
<strong>Gary:</strong> Yeah, sure Craig absolutely. First of all, I’d like to say thanks for having me on Solar Tea Time. I’ve seen the previous ones and they’re great and I’m excited that that you asked me to join you here today. So, I think that these tips are very applicable regardless of the type of organization that you’re in. It will be company specific, or project specific as to which one’s apply more than others. I would say that generally in larger companies, you must require engaging more stakeholders versus smaller companies where you have a smaller set of stakeholders who are all still looking at the same types of items that we talk about here. I’ve seen that firsthand. I come from <a href=""https://recsolar.com/blogs/duke-energy-is-investing-in-rec-solar-to-grow-the-commercial-solar-market/"">Duke Energy</a> which is REC’s majority owned parent company so I’ve seen the large company aspect of getting projects approved and then I’ve also worked at smaller companies as well. Overall, I think that they all apply and it is interesting for folks to kind of think about exactly how it works for their organization

<strong>Craig:</strong> Let’s set the stage here. We’ve got a project and the stakeholders have agreed to go to the CFO as one of the last steps. We’re about to pitch to you and you outlined seven things that we should be thinking of.
<h4>The first of which is cash situation. What do you mean by that Gary? What should people be thinking of from a cash situation perspective before they talk to the CFO?</h4>
<strong>Gary:</strong> I’ve always said and heard cash is king, right? You know that is the first thing to start with whenever you’re talking to a CFO. He or she is a finance professional who is going to want to know what the economics are. Does it make financial sense from an investment standpoint? Projects won’t get done and approved unless they make straight financial sense. I’m also thinking about whether this is a strong economic project or are we doing this project for other reasons and other benefits?

<strong>Craig:</strong> Okay, good, the next one probably follows on the cash situation. You want to talk about the investment structure.
<h4>What do you mean by that investment structure and what should people be aware of?</h4>
<strong>Gary</strong>: Yeah, 1 &amp; 2 really go together. One is how do the economics look and then the other is how are we from a savings standpoint? Does this project make financial sense? The second one with the investment structure is how are we going to invest them so it saves us money. Especially with solar, there’s really two main approaches to investing or participating in a <a href=""https://www.recsolar.com/case-studies/"">solar project</a>. You can either own the project outright which means I’m investing cash in the project and building it or paying a company to build it but then I own that project long term. Or I can do a power purchase agreement where effectively I’m paying another company a rate for electricity but I don’t own the facility and so it really comes down to, as the CFO, how do I want to use my cash? What do I want my balance sheet to look like? Do I have the cash available to invest? Do I have the tax appetite to take advantage of the tax benefits that come with solar and come with ownership or do I view electricity as an expense that I just want to sign a contract and pay a lower rate for that power? So that’s where I think it’s important in dealing with solar how I would structure that investment and depending on the outcome of that, it also has an impact on our financial statements. There’s accounting implications regarding which direction we choose from an investment standpoint. I think those are important things that I would consider whenever deciding about which approach. How are we going to do the project and then which approach we would take once we think about the economics from the start.

<strong>Craig:</strong> Yep, okay. Great.
<h4>The third one you have is a time commitment and tell me what you mean by the time commitment when you’re talking to a CFO?</h4>
<strong>Gary:</strong> I think we’re all looking for workforce productivity, so we kind of look at this as the economics. We’ve looked at the investment decision. How are we going to structure from a cash standpoint. Now its is this the best use of time for the organization to focus on this type of project? Most organizations are not in the power generating business and so they have other areas of focus for their organization. Is this the best use of our time both from an initial investment standpoint as well as an ongoing operational standpoint and I think that’s it’s critically important. Something that people may not think about necessarily directly related to the CFO role but, at our organization, the effectiveness and productivity of that workforce is one of the key areas that I think about and focus on and so that’s something I think would be helpful to address as you have that conversation with what your CFOs.

<strong>Craig:</strong> Gary when you talk with that, are you basically translating time into money? Is that kind of what you’re looking for?

<strong>Gary:</strong> That’s exactly right Craig. Time does mean money with the CFO. I don’t know if you need to do a direct calculation of that but within my head that’s kind of the map that I’m doing and then similarly it makes the decision as to what approach that I would want to take. Do I want to invest the time commitment into owning a facility that comes with operational aspects or do I want to go with an energy partner that owns and operates and I pay for that power the same way that I do my utility bill today? I’d be getting the benefits of solar but without the operational aspects. That’s just some of the mental math that that I’m doing as I’m thinking about this project.

<strong>Craig:</strong> Great. So that dovetails into risks, which is number four.
<h4>What should someone be prepared for on the topic of risk when they talk to a CFO?</h4>
<strong>Gary:</strong> In addition to being the chief financial officer, we’re also chief risk officers. We are responsible for risks of the company. I think it is critically important for anyone having a conversation with the CFO to be upfront and transparent with the risks of the project. It’s very important to articulate those and also have a mitigation to each one of those risks. whenever you as a stakeholder in this project presented to me as the CFO. As a decision maker, it really gives me confidence that you’re being transparent, you’re being upfront, you’re being clear that these are the economic benefits of this project, these are the risks that are associated with it, and this is how we would mitigate these risks.

<strong>Craig:</strong> Makes total sense. What does the CFO really care about?

<strong>Gary:</strong> You know; the vendor you choose. I mean, this might be a softball response for you but who am I getting into business with with my dollars?

<strong>Craig:</strong> Tell me about vendor due diligence.

<strong>Gary:</strong> The vendor that we go with is a key risk item. This is a solar facility. A thirty-year power plant that is potentially going on a roof, ground mount or carport and will be at our facility for 30 years. 30 years is a long time and so you really want the quality and the standards of a <a href=""https://sustainablesolutions-duke-energy-com-staging.go-vip.net/about/"">true energy partner</a> that you’re going into business with. Again, whether that is from a construction standpoint, I want to ensure that its built with the quality and standards that it’s going to last for 30 years and provide me that benefit because I’m investing my capital upfront with the expectation of long-term savings coming off that project or I’m going with the <a href=""https://sustainablesolutions-duke-energy-com-staging.go-vip.net/services/renewables-financing/ppa/"">PPA</a> structure. It’s critical that I feel confident in the person I’m going really going into business with.

<strong>Craig:</strong> You talk about alternatives. Is this presenting different alternatives to the CFO?

<strong>Gary:</strong> I would just be prepared for this question. Did you look at anything else other than the type of project? The CFO may have saw something on the news talking about some other type of technology or some other company or something else. Be prepared and again it instills the confidence in me as a decision maker. Did you look at anything else other than just this one project that you’re selling me? Yep we sure did. We looked at X, Y, Z. We think this project makes the most sense because this reason and that reason. You’re not going to be going into the full detail into exactly all the analysis that you performed on your other alternatives but it gives me the confidence that you at least thought about other approaches to this project and that this is the best one out of the other ones that you looked at.

<strong>Craig:</strong> Finally you talk about corporate mission.
<h4>Tell me what the CFO is looking for in terms of how this fits in with the corporate mission.</h4>
<strong>Gary:</strong> As I mentioned, step number one is cash savings, the cash situation of a project. Some projects do get do get done because of sustainability missions or employee benefits. There could be carports that provide shade for employee’s vehicles, provide, hail protection if you’re in a hail zone. There are employee benefits that are not necessarily monetized but that engage the workforce.

<strong>Craig:</strong> Tell me Gary, how would you want this presented to you?

<strong>Gary:</strong> Yeah. It’s interesting actually. I’ve seen it be successful in a couple of different ways. I’d say one is a simple PowerPoint presentation that outlines each one of these. I do think it’s important to have some type of written material that a CFO can look at. Time is scarce for everyone so have some prep material that they can preview ahead of time. What REC does is create a brief white paper. Nothing too long. It could be just a couple of pages long but a white paper that lays out each one of these areas in a brief and succinct way that gives me the ability to clearly wrap my head around that project before we have the interaction.

<strong>Craig:</strong> I’m going to give you one of my little sales tips. Speak in the same language of the person you’re talking to. If your CFO uses certain phrases, or talks some certain way, take on their point of view and mimic that back to them to speak their language and you will better be able to get your message across.

Gary, thank you for baring your soul to us. This has been great and I think our listeners appreciated it. Feel free to email us if we didn’t get to your questions or if you have anything additional for us. Cheers!",,,

<strong>Craig Noxon:</strong> Hello, everyone! Welcome to Solar Tea Time. I’m Craig Noxon, I’m VP of Enterprise Sales at REC Solar. And my special guest for this month is John Hostetter. He’s the Senior Director of Products at REC Solar. Before we get started a little housekeeping, as always, I wanted you to all be aware that your line is muted but you can type questions inside the Webcast under the questions tab. And we’ll try and answer those at the end at the broadcast and if we don’t get to them we’ll certainly follow-up with you via email.

OK, that’s it for the logistics. Let’s get to the topic of today which is Solar + Storage. All the questions and comments we’ve had come in at Solar Tea Time, Solar and Storage by far is the one that comes up most and it’s the trending topic. It’s high tea time that we do so. Lucky for us we have John on hand as our expert to introduce the topic. And in future of Solar Tea Times we’ll be able to delve into this topic a little bit more but we have 20 minutes here. John, thanks and welcome to Solar Tea Time. I hope you have a cup of something caffeinated, some tea perhaps because this is a big topic to cover. So, we’ll get started right away with some of the questions that came in.

First and foremost, John, maybe you can shed some light and kind of open the floor.
<h4>What’s new with solar and storage and maybe you can then delve into any specific policy changes that we should be aware of.</h4>
<strong>John Hostetter:</strong> Great. Well, thanks Craig. I appreciate the introduction and it’s a good question to start off with. Here in California where I am, there’s the <a href=""https://energy.gov/savings/self-generation-incentive-program"">Self-Generation Incentive Program</a> which has been open for the last couple of months. And what that is, is it’s usually abbreviated SGIP and it’s an incentive program that reduces the cost of installing storage and it favors Solar + Storage. It’s a little bit like the old CSI Rebate Program for solar and that it is a tiered structure, essentially what that means is over time the rebate will be less valuable for those projects. So the incentive is intended to get projects installed in the near term, help the industry get the cost down and get the word out about storage. It’s a great program. Definitely ask about it if you’re considering a project.
<h4>What do you mean by that John, that it’s over time the incentive drops down somewhere to ITC or some other programs that become less valuable in the years to come?</h4>
<strong>John Hostetter:</strong> Exactly, exactly. As more and more projects get built with Solar + Storage and claim this incentive program, the value per project goes down. There’s a fixed amount and then periodically as more projects are installed, the dollar value per project is reduced.

<strong>Craig Noxon:</strong> OK.

<strong>John Hostetter:</strong> That’s exactly right. And then also here in California, the major public utilities are along with the CPUC are evaluating a proposal to change the time of use buckets on their rate tariffs for <a href=""https://sustainablesolutions-duke-energy-com-staging.go-vip.net/solutions/distributed-generation/solar-energy/"">commercial customers</a>. So what that means is that they’re going to change how much the customers are paid and when they pay those various rates. And rather than get too in the weeds there, the upshot is it’s going to change the relative value of solar and storage to customers. For most customers, it’s going to increase the value of storage especially when coupled with solar. And so it is making the combined project better than either one separately.

<strong>Craig Noxon:</strong> And why is that, John?
<h4>Why is it better if it’s combined with solar?</h4>
<strong>John Hostetter:</strong> Specifically with the time of use shift the utilities are changing when you pay certain amounts for power and so the way it used to work and the way it currently works is during the middle of the day when solar is producing the best that was also the most valuable time for solar to produce. And the proposals put forth by the various utilities are changing that so that those high time of use buckets, those high time of use rates are later in the day so they don’t line up quite as well with solar. But with storage, you could still get the benefit of that. You can still use that power at the most financially beneficially time.

And then there’s a few other things going on as well but the summary is that many of the time of use rates are going up and so that is also beneficial for storage.

<strong>Craig Noxon:</strong> You mentioned California.
<h4>Can you speak a little about solar and storage outside of California?</h4>
<strong>John Hostetter:</strong> That’s a good question. Massachusetts, Hawaii, New York and Colorado all have programs in development or are just about to come out and they’re going to benefit storage a little too varied to get into in a short time frame. But if you’re considering a project and you have some a facility in one of those locations, we can certainly help you with the specifics. Across the United States, the<a href=""https://sustainablesolutions-duke-energy-com-staging.go-vip.net/resources/calculate-solar-tax-credit-2021/""> Federal Investment Tax Credit</a>, the ITC is going to be beneficial as well. You can claim ITC on the storage potion of your project as long as you’re also installing solar. So you have to install them approximately at the same time and then they have to end up with the same owner. So, if you’re going to own them both yourself or if you’re going to have the same financier for both of them, then you can claim ITC on the value of the entire project.

There are few other requirements that storage has to be mostly charged by the solar which if you’re analyzing them at the same time and working through the project at the same time rather than using two separate vendors or you’re going to gain some benefits, some synergy from talking to one company who can help you with both of these. Both so that you can claim the ITC as well as make sure that you’re seeing the full value of both of them, getting the synergy out of both of them from the effect of analyzing them both at the same time, you’re going to see reduced equipment and installation cost and a short overall installation timeline if you do both at the same time also.

<strong>Craig Noxon:</strong> If you just doing storage without solar, you don’t get ITC credits for storage.

<strong>John Hostetter:</strong> Correct.

<strong>Craig Noxon:</strong> Yeah, OK. Let’s move on into the next question which is.
<h4>What are good candidates for solar and storage? You can talk about it from a business and from a geographic standpoint.</h4>
<strong>John Hostetter:</strong> From a business standpoint, in general, you’re going to look for large spiky loads. And what does that mean? It means motors, pumps, heavy machinery that turn on and off at one time or where we see lots of testing in laboratories, processing plants those sorts of things. When you’re talking about let’s say agriculture, some of the agriculture rates are not really beneficial even though they have large pumping loads which are intermittent. It’s worth talking to with somebody and doing some analysis there to see if it’s going to work for you or your specific situation.

However, there are many Ag customers where it is going to work better and you know as I mentioned whether it’s a processing plant or storage facility those tend to look a lot better than some of the pumping. But again, pumping does have to have the right profile it just depends on whether the rates are truly supported. Office buildings, they can work as well and heating, ventilation and air-conditioning loads tend to be quick. It tends to be uncontrolled and so when the building heats up, the whole building heats up at once and so a lot of those HVAC equipment tends to turn on at one time. And you know computers, people come in right after lunch or even in the morning and they turn those on so they also tend to have some of those spiky loads.

We’ve seen schools and other types of facilities as well that have excellent load profiles. You know what? It really comes down to with any customer with a large utility bill specifically the demand charge is something that we’re going to want to target with solar and storage. The thing about storage is that it’s very dependent on both the rate tariff, what is the utility charging you for as well as the way you use your power? And so, it’s worth doing that analysis.
<h4>And then what do you analyze and how are you– how do customers know if they are good candidates for solar + storage?</h4>
<strong>John Hostetter:</strong> Well, we’re going to look at your site and we’re going to analyze it for what is your energy use profile and how you are using energy and when you are using energy? Are you using enough energy that solar is required? Are you using energy in a manner and at a time of day that the storage is going to be effective at reducing your out of pocket spend? We’re going to look at your interval data which is the recording of how and when you have used power over time. And then combine that with our ability to predict what the storage is able to do for you as well as the solar production we can craft a solution that is best for the customer.

<strong>Craig Noxon:</strong> OK.

<strong>John Hostetter:</strong> For some specific examples, I won’t give customer names to keep them private. But we’ve worked with some companies that are big box stores that have bought this for distribution and customer-facing sites. Some of those customer-facing sites look great and some of them not so much. It really depends on the usage profile and the rate structure that they’re on. And then similarly with their distribution sites, while some of them will do it, some of them are not good fits so where it’s not going to be financially beneficial, we’re happy to tell the customer what is going to be best for them.

<strong>Craig Noxon:</strong> Mm-hmm.

<strong>John Hostetter:</strong> We’d rather be a good partner that way.

<strong>Craig Noxon:</strong> John, I’ve seen that the solar industry kind of continues to move not just from where it’s better than utilities in places like California and <a href=""https://sustainablesolutions-duke-energy-com-staging.go-vip.net/resources/waianae-solar/"">Hawaii</a>, it’s moved to the East Coast, we’re seeing installations in the Midwest kind of all over these days. Where is storage in that trajectory? Can you compare this with the solar from a geographic standpoint?

<strong>John Hostetter:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. There’s some result to solar where you have a very large market in California and then Hawaii is a good market for solar and some of the other states depending on their utility and support for solar. And then quite a few of the Northeastern states, again, depending in the utility structure and support of solar is how the solar industry has developed. The storage portion of that especially when combined with solar lines up very closely.

California is a great market for storage. We tend to have higher rates here in California in the way that support storage. Hawaii, Hawaii has some special concerns that make storage very appealing out there. Here on the mainland, there’s a lot more just electrical infrastructure, we call that the grid. And our power tends to be cheaper than the islands. And so, Hawaii has special needs for storage that really help make everything work better out there.

In addition to Hawaii, there’s a few of the Northeastern states as well as, let’s say Colorado, that have <a href=""https://sustainablesolutions-duke-energy-com-staging.go-vip.net/services/renewables-financing/"">programs that are going to financially</a> make storage more viable as well as rate structures and utilities that understand the value to them of the customers having some storage. It’s going to make more senses up there. You know that’s not to say that in the middle of the country or other places that I haven’t mentioned are going to be bad for storage but it’s worth or doing some analysis.

<strong>Craig Noxon:</strong> OK. The third question we’ve kind of touched on that is how does a company pay for Solar + Storage?
<h3>And is there a benefit for doing both at the same time?</h3>
<strong>John Hostetter:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. Companies can pay for solar and storage the same way they’re going to pay for any of the other – any of their other infrastructure projects or energy projects, right? So, if they have funds available they can certainly purchase via cash, internal financing or cash in the bank. They can go to their own financial institution or bank and get their own financing. Whether that’s a loan or lease, I know that many banks can do either one of those for their customers. And then the energy vendor that you’re working with is going to essentially sign an EPC contract and treat it more like a cash sale from their perspective.

There are lots of different financing means available though. For those customers that don’t necessarily have a pile of cash waiting around for them to spend it on a capital improvement project, there are PPAs and lease programs available. We can certainly provide a PPA that allows the customer, our customer to save money every money right out of the gate with essentially no money down, no money upfront and then, very low risk. There are performance guarantees and well understood production and performance on both sides of that system.

<strong>Craig Noxon:</strong> Yeah.

<strong>John Hostetter:</strong> There are other more innovative financing structures available where you might have a PPA for the solar and capacity or lease-like payment for the storage. The details are a little bit too much to get into in the time we have available today but those are available.

<strong>Craig Noxon:</strong> Speaking of customer questions.
<h4>How do you choose a vendor when you evaluate the storage? What should people be looking for?</h4>
<strong>John Hostetter:</strong> That’s an excellent question too. One of the things that I always recommend is, you look at not just the company you’re buying from, right? Is this a company that has your best interest at heart? Compare performance metrics. If you’re only going to look at one performance metric for storage, then you would say that you should look at the roundtrip proficiency of the system. Is it as is competitive and not worse one on the market you know? And so what that means is that’s a measure of how much energy is lost when you are charging and discharging the battery?

<strong>Craig Noxon:</strong> Uh-huh.

<strong>John Hostetter:</strong> There’s going to be some off the heat and just efficiency with the equipment and so forth. And that’s a number that has to be published. And so go ahead and ask the vendor what their offering you then. I also recommend looking at the details of the warranty of the actual equipment that’s being offered. Some warranties are much better than others not just as far as links, duration of warranty but also what are they actually warranting? How many cycles per day is the battery able to do and still have that warranty? How many cycles per day are they expecting it to do? Not just what does it warrant to do but what are they expecting it to perform at? And then how much power is left in that battery at the end of warranty? Those can vary tremendously across the industry. And so you want– you want one of the better warranties then.

<strong>Craig Noxon:</strong> OK.

<strong>John Hostetter:</strong> Any time you’re talking about warranties, you want to make sure that the company that is providing those warranties has a depth and financial stability in the marketplace. Are they having financial troubles or are they the kind of company that has shown they can withstand the test of time.

<strong>Craig Noxon:</strong> We have time for one last quick question and it’s somewhat related but the question is.
<h4>Which storage products does REC work with and how do they compare with other storage product in the market?</h4>
<strong>John Hostetter:</strong> Mm-hmm. And so, we allow ourselves the flexibility to choose the best products on the marketplace for the customer. We don’t like to lock ourselves into any one specific piece of equipment or vendor because we want the flexibility to choose what’s best for the customer and bring them a solution that’s going to work best for them. There’s an old analogy where if a hammer is your only tool then everything starts to look like a nail. In the <a href=""https://sustainablesolutions-duke-energy-com-staging.go-vip.net/solutions/distributed-generation/energy-storage/"">solar and storage</a> and other energy marketplace, if you only one have one product that you can sell, then you’re going to recommend it to everyone even if it isn’t necessarily the best fit for them. And you’re going to tell people it’s the best because it’s the only thing you have. Whereas what we like to do is give a solution and propose a solution that we feel is the best for the customer not just for us.

<strong>Craig Noxon:</strong> It’s about time we wrap up, so thanks for sharing the Storage insights for our listeners. If anyone would like to talk more to John or to I about solar and storage, feel free to email us. You can also email us if you have any additional questions and we will get back and answer those for you. Please join us next month when we will be giving tips from a CFO on how people should sell their ideas and projects internally. So, thanks John, on behalf of REC. Cheers! Bye!

<strong>Craig Noxon:</strong> Hello, everyone! Welcome to Solar Tea Time. I’m Craig Noxon, VP of Enterprise Sales at REC Solar. My special guest today is Jesse Elliott, Senior Director of Safety and Quality at REC Solar.

Let’s get ready for the topic of the day, Safety and Quality. With me is Jesse Elliott. Jesse is actually calling us from his vacation in South Dakota where he’s with his family.

<strong>Craig Noxon:</strong> The first question is
<h4>Why do I need to worry about a company safety record when I hire them? What happens if someone gets injured during a job?</h4>
<strong>Jesse Elliott:</strong> Great question. Let me throw out an example to our listeners to see if they can answer this question with their gut instinct as to why it is important to be concerned about a contractor’s safety record performance. So, here is an absolute real-world example of what could happen during a <a href=""https://sustainablesolutions-duke-energy-com-staging.go-vip.net/solutions/distributed-generation/solar-energy/"">solar construction project</a>.

So the first example, you’re an owner of a large facility complex with many skylights on your roof. Your solar contractor begins the job. You never bothered to see if they setup all protection on the roof. But halfway through the construction, a worker is walking backwards along sky modules, trips over skylight, shatters the skylight and falls 35 feet below to his death in the middle of your manufacturing facility, the supermarket, the school, your office building. Do you think that’s a problem for you? I think most would agree.

In this example customers have the major problems to deal with through lack of health and safety compliance of contractors that they have selected. So, customers who are hiring contractors for construction need to worry about contractor compliance which requires safety laws, just as owners need to be compliant with safety laws that apply to the operation of their facilities. Most entities in the US operate under construction or general industry OSHA which is Occupational Health and Safety Standard Administration. If you’re a business owner, you’re required to implement general industry safety and health rules at your fixed location. If you’re a construction company, you’re required to implement construction OSHA Safety Rules during construction. If you’re an owner, you need to make sure that contractor you hired to perform that work is also implementing construction OSHA rules during the project.

Let’s go back to our example. You’re going to have legal issues to deal with, you’re going to have operational delays due to a crime scene that’s now at your facility, right? With this death, and the sheer knowledge that a fatality occurred on your premises were your employees were exposed is such a horrible event, right? It’s a nightmare for a company.

So, just a couple of things that for our listeners to look for. First is the safety record. The contractor should have an EMR, which is an Experience Modification Rate relating to worker’s compensation. It tells you how well you are compared to your peers in your classification. You’re looking for EMR less than 1.0 or maybe between 1.0, 1.25 but they should have a very good explanation of why they’re within that range.

You can check to see if contractors have OSHA violations by checking on <a href=""https://www.osha.gov/"">OSHA’s website</a>. You need to check to make sure your contractors have safety programs and systems in place to ensure not only compliance but promote a positive healthy and safety culture. So minimum major programs that should be in place by your contractors would be an Illness and injury prevention program, a heat illness prevention program and check that they have communication for protection, observation and trenching and watchful safety material. There are dozens of other ones that you could throw in there. Those are kind of the main ones that customers should be looking for with a contractor.

It is not only important that they are in place but also that they’re being implemented and enforced. Safety programs seen in the binder and a job trailer and a job site do nobody any good. They need to be used. They need to be referenced and implemented continuously. So, my last advice is from a customer’s perspective. When a facility manager or the actual owner show up during construction, inspect for yourself. You must inspect what you expect. And it should not be on the last day of construction. Any good contractor has a weekly safety inspection form. So shadow them on one inspection. This educates not only the customer but also shows on the customer side that you’re concerned about the well-being of the workforce and not having an accident in this operation.

For REC we’ve been sold to some of the top companies in the nation including <a href=""https://sustainablesolutions-duke-energy-com-staging.go-vip.net/industries/federal-government/"">government, military work</a>. You don’t even get in the door with these folks unless you have a robust health and safety program. I’d like to think that we have built some very robust safety programs and have definitely created this strong safety culture that comes from our senior leadership down to our employees in the field. It’s both a top-down and a bottoms-up involvement.

<strong>Craig Noxon:</strong> In my role Jesse, as VP of Enterprise Sales, we deal with customers where safety is a primary concern.
<h4>But the question to you is what kind of questions should customers be asking about quality when they’re evaluating a solar provider?</h4>
<strong>Jesse Elliott:</strong> I think that’s going to depend on whether you’re a Fortune 1000 company and you’re an energy manager is looking to put solar on multiple facilities across the nation in different geographical regions let’s say from Hawaii to the East Coast or in the Central Valley in California. The questions can vary. But in general, I would say, the following should be asked at minimum. Is the system being designed and engineered by industry experts? It’s crucial to have an EPC firm, an Engineering, Procurement and Construction firm that I can value engineer a system for the space that you may have available for solar.

Next question, are energy production numbers and corresponding cash flow analysis accurate? Quality systems start all the way back in the sales cycle during customer’s first interaction with technical sales associates where they’re trying to understand the customer’s need. What is the return that the customer is looking for? You want an <a href=""https://sustainablesolutions-duke-energy-com-staging.go-vip.net/solutions/distributed-generation/solar-energy/"">EPC firm</a> that has tools that quickly and accurately generate and balance the economics of your system.

Next, I could specifically relate into overall company quality would be does the EPC contractor have a quality management system and an in-house quality department? Quality is not just filling out a checklist during and after material.

Over my 10 years at REC Solar, I’ve come to define quality as two things, quality assurance and quality control. Quality assurance is in my definition all the consistent and repeatable processes that are put in place to add value to an organization in order to deliver quality products which includes quality control. You see it’s a process under your quality assurance. Quality control is just a physical act of expecting work for compliance to set a known quality standard whether that’s following design review checklist or inspecting an inverter that has just been installed for proper mounting and terminating.

<strong>Jesse Elliott:</strong> It is also important that an EPC has an inhouse safety and quality department. That <a href=""https://sustainablesolutions-duke-energy-com-staging.go-vip.net/services/operations-maintenance/"">safety and quality</a> department helps drive safety and quality culture within an organization. All the departments feeding construction need to deliver quality drawings, materials. Because the job of the QMS is to provide a strong quality training program that gives instructions to teams, to build systems correctly the first time. Contractors need to have training programs in place to rapidly train the workforce on how to do things correctly the first time.

<strong>Craig Noxon:</strong> Right. And make sure their subs are following safety rules.

<strong>Craig Noxon:</strong> Jesse we have one-minute left so I just wanted to quickly touch on the last question.
<h4>And that’s how do I know that the materials being used in my installation will meet my needs? What can customers do to make sure that we’re using the right kind of equipment?</h4>
<strong>Jesse Elliott:</strong> Customers don’t necessarily know that there is a product that was selected or installation method that was implemented and if it is the right one. I’ve made our teams or our subcontractors fix even after the final punch list slot from the customer because again, we’re delivering high quality. We’re going to make what we told the customer.

It important for us to choose the right quality materials for systems to last. We can have environmental corrosion, structural failure, water intrusion, damage to the facility, if materials are not chosen correctly. It is important to see the correct material chosen for the environment whether it’s installed in Hawaii, Tucson, Arizona or the East Coast.

<strong>Craig Noxon:</strong> Yeah, you have to take the weather into account you know salt water and rain. Jesse, do you have any kind of closing thoughts in terms of safety and maybe what customers and other contractors will be looking for in this topic?

<strong>Jesse Elliott:</strong> Sure. In an ideal world, I hope all customers care about safety and quality as much as I do. We are in an industry right now that’s in a precarious point. Costs are being driven down or we’re required to drive our cost down. We’re looking in all areas to reduce those costs. As long as I’m in this industry, there’s no way I’m sacrificing quality product, quality of installation, safety, etcetera. If there are customers out there that are looking for the right EPC contractor to build, you want to make sure that what you paid for is going to last, what you paid for is not going to have an accident on your jobsite when your contractor is building. That point is going to have unknown hidden cost that the customer doesn’t want to deal with. So, I guess those are my closing comments relating to safety and quality.

<strong>Craig Noxon:</strong> OK. Great. Well, thanks Jesse. Thanks for sharing your insights.

<strong>Craig: </strong>Hello everyone, welcome to solar tea time. I’m Craig Noxon, Vice President of Enterprise Sales. My special guest expert for this month is Chris Hiller, the Energy Solutions Architect at REC Solar. Let’s get started with some interesting discussion about the latest trends in solar. As the <a href=""https://sustainablesolutions-duke-energy-com-staging.go-vip.net/solutions/distributed-generation/solar-energy/"">solar and renewable energy</a> landscape continues to evolve, we often get questions that we know others must have so we decided to put on a semi-regular series where we can address these topics head-on in a fun and hopefully creative way. Today’s hot topic is time of use shifts in California. So, Chris I hope you have your tea in hand and I wanted to start off if you can just give us a little bit of background.
<h4>What’s happening with time-of-use shifts? What’s happening with customer’s bills today and what do these shifts potentially mean for them?</h4>
<strong>Chris: </strong>Thanks for the intro Craig. To really understand the time-of-use shift, we’ve got to first back up a little bit, just to make sure everyone has an understanding of how an electric bill is derived or sent to you from a utility company or third-party provider. Essentially your bill breaks down into two major components and it’s going to be your kilowatt hour charges versus your kilowatt charges. Kilowatt hours essentially is the flow of electricity over time. Your kilowatt charge is really your highest peak instantaneous load and that can happen at any one point in time during the month. Typically, depending on your utility, your energy charges are going to comprise about sixty percent of your bill and your demand charges, or your kW charges, that’s going to comprise about forty percent of your bill. Solar, because it’s dependent on the weather, can’t predictably offset your demand charges or your kW charges. When looking at an investment like solar we’re really just focused on the kilowatt hours. So with that, I think what we’ve got to do is back up to thirty years ago or so in the state of California when the current time-of-use buckets were set and essentially what that was was a lot of HVAC load in the state and that really drove the summer peak rate, if you will, that’s kind of your most expensive time to purchase energy was set between noon and 4:00 in SE territory or noon and 6:00 and PG&amp;E territory. But really just right in the middle of the day when businesses are operating, that’s when electricity charges throughout the year were highest. So fast forward to today where we’ve got this proposed time-of-use coming from the utilities. What they decided to do, and working with the CPUC, was propose new times to charge those peak rates. They proposed somewhere in the range of 4 p.m. and 9 p.m. or even 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. So they’re looking to move that peak towards the later part of the day when people are getting home from work or businesses are ramping down. In effect, what that does is lower your energy rates during those summer peak times and they’re increasing your off-peak rates. So now the off-peak window is going to be a lot higher than it was before but your overall net effect of your bill is going to basically remain the same. So if you had a hundred thousand dollar-a-year electric bill in 2016, you’re 2018 projected energy bill should be right around that same value even though they’ve pushed these time-of-use buckets around quite a bit.

<strong>Craig: </strong>So the totals should be about the same but they’re shifting the buckets and the times around from what they used to be, correct?

<strong>Chris: </strong>Correct.

<strong>Craig: </strong>And you said proposed so it’s not a done deal yet?
<h4>Do we know what those new time of use hours are going to be?</h4>
<strong>Chris: </strong>Yeah. The first one that was supposed to be voted upon by the CPUC was <a href=""http://www.sdge.com/"">SDG&amp;E</a> and really what we’re talking about here are the three major utilities in California. So that’s SDG&amp;E, <a href=""http://www.pge.com/"">PG&amp;E </a>and <a href=""http://www.sce.com/"">SCE</a>. If you’ve got direct access on your facility and you’re buying your energy from a third party, your time-of- use shifts are going to have less of an effect on your bill then if you’re buying all of your energy retail or your electricity retail from the utility company. So that being said, SDG&amp;E was supposed to get voted upon last month by the PUC but they’ve actually already postponed that decision. We’re supposed to hear about it probably sometime next month once the decision has been made it’s going to take them 45 days to actually write the tariff and implement the tariff but that date will probably also slip just knowing the utilities. So I think SDG&amp;E is going to be coming out sometime this summer. We’re going to know and then we’re going to use that as somewhat of a litmus test as to what the CPUC is going to grant SCE as well as PG&amp;E. The ruling on SCE is supposed to come out in October, November timeframe of this year and PG&amp;E is supposed to be coming out in January of 2018.

<strong>Craig: </strong>Ok so clearly, this looks like it should have some impact for solar in California.
<h4>Can you speak a little bit about what you see as the impact that these two new shifts will have on the solar industry in the state.</h4>
<strong>Chris: </strong>I think on the whole, after modeling a lot of different scenarios over the last four months and kind of looking at the proposed rates as they have been proposed by the utility companies, our perspective is on the worst-case scenario so typically the utility company will go to the CPUC with some sort of a rate change. The utilities change their rates roughly four times a year and they enter into some sort of negotiation with the CPUC but in this particular case, again they’ve never asked to change the time of use periods and they haven’t done so for the last 30 years. In any event, in looking at the worst-case scenario essentially the CPUC, let’s assume the CPUC grants the utility everything that they’ve asked for. We’re still seeing throughout California  that solar is right around that three to five year payback and some of them are better and some of them are a little bit worse and I think some of those cases I can just name off the top are PG&amp;E Ag rates. Ag rates in PG&amp;E territory have been subsidized for a number of years and it seems now during this time of use change in this new proposed rate they’re removing those subsidies on ag rates. Across the board everything I’ve looked at in the ag territory looks like ag rates for PG&amp;E are going to go up roughly thirty percent, twenty to thirty percent which then correlates to really high savings for solar which means that if you invest in solar on an ag rate, you’re going to see better paybacks, you’re going to be closer to that three-year window versus something like an industrial rate in PG&amp;E. I think the goal in PG&amp;E territory as well as throughout the state is to implement renewables on site. You want to try to make the site eligible for option R. So all three utilities have this subsidized rate that is called option R, but it’s not available to ag clients so this really only pertains to commercial industrial rates and you have to install fifteen percent of your either annual energy load or your monthly kW. Your rating of your solar electric system would have to be at least 15 percent of essentially what you consume and that will then enable you to get onto this subsidized rate and for PG&amp;E clients what that is is it essentially drops your demand charges by 50% or so, so most of your savings are going to come from your demand savings and typically we want to install at least you know 30 percent of your load on site in PG&amp;E territory to really make that pencil. SDG&amp;E territory is probably the best to go solar in although they’re probably the most primitive to work with. I mean SDG&amp;E outsources everything but as far as rates go, SDG&amp;E territory is really probably the best rate in the entire state. SCE rates probably are the most difficult to work with I would say under the new proposed shifts and that’s simply because they’ve lowered their demand charges or their energy charges and they’ve increased their demand charges more than anybody else. So again, solar can really offset the demand charge so when we’re just focused on the energy charge, the paybacks are not as good. But SCE still has option R available. We’re predicting that there’s a 400 megawatt cap. We’ve been tracking it and it looks like somewhere around Summer 2018 is when it’s going to be fully subscribed. If you want to get on option R in SDE territory, you need to contract for the end of this year.

<strong>Craig: </strong>for SCE the others do not have a deadline for option R?

<strong>Chris: </strong>Correct.

<strong>Craig: </strong>Okay, option R is decreasing your demand, it’s increasing your energy charges and then the way to feel about it is if you do have solar you’re clearly <a href=""https://sustainablesolutions-duke-energy-com-staging.go-vip.net/resources/energy-demand-charges-explained/"">decreasing your energy charges</a>. The R is for renewable correct?

<strong>Chris: </strong>Yeah.

<strong>Craig: </strong>It’s only something available to solar customers?

<strong>Chris: </strong>You can install wind or hydro but again, trying to get a permit on a wind turbine in an industrial park is a lot more difficult than installing solar.

<strong>Craig: </strong>Yeah, okay. So I’m sure a lot of people are wondering, how do these TOU shifts apply to them and is there a way that they can figure out what these energy changes are going to mean for their bills coming up over the next couple years?

<strong>Chris: </strong>I would just say that bills are predominantly going to remain consistent. I would say the only outlier to that is PG&amp;E AG customers on a grade like all the other well pumps in the valley those are going to be hit pretty hard. Outside of that, the rates themselves, the total blend when you go through the analysis and you had a hundred thousand dollar-a-year annual bill let’s say under the current time of use standards and then we go look at 2018 and what’s proposed, that same load profile, looking at all the interval data you put that into the into the new time use bucket, it still models out to roughly a hundred-thousand-dollar bill. They did that, you know, in talking with all the advocacy groups and talking with the CPUC there was a lot of forethought that was intentional because they didn’t want to create a new rate tariff structure and have everybody’s bill double or have a massive increase in annual electric spend because then that would potentially lead to lawsuits or litigation. So, for now I would say there’s probably not going to be a big monumental shift in the annual energy spend or electric spends but you know, it does impact the generation that you proposed you want to put on site. either it’s solar or cogen or what-have-you or storage, you know, different technologies converge.

<strong>Craig: </strong>Yeah let me ask you about that because so clearly one way to hedge against any kind of TOU shifts might be option R but a lot of people are talking about storage specifically in California.
<h4>How can that help people and impact their utility rates and payments?</h4>
<strong>Chris: </strong>When talking about storage, I think I zero right in on SCE and the proposed rates SCE put out because they really have increased their demand charges so much so that solar plus storage has the best, I would say, the best bang for the buck. The best rate of return for SCE clients. Predominantly TOU eight is the best rate tariff in the entire state for solar plus storage and then from there just kind of splinters out. There’s going to be some cases like on a GS2 and SD territory with option R where storage just does not make any sense or in a 10 SDG&amp;E territory with option R doesn’t make any sense to implement storage. So I think it’s on a case-by-case basis. But really you want to focus on the rates where your demand charges are incredibly high.

<strong>Craig: </strong>Yep. Chris, we have just a couple minutes left and we had some questions come in. One of them is about,
<h4>What grandfathering periods will be available for current customers with solar?</h4>
<strong>Chris: </strong>Current customers with solar are grandfathered in for the next ten years under the current time of use bucket. But, you will be subject to the new rates that are going to take them back or if your system is not already installed you have to have an installed solar electric system by July 31st of this year and you would have had to have submitted an interconnect application by January 31st 2017 in order to be eligible for the grandfathering. Or if you’re a school, you can have your system installed by December 31st of 2017 in order to be grandfathered in.

<strong>Craig: </strong>Okay I think maybe one last question. You touched on this a little bit but can you more explicitly talk a little bit about the <a href=""https://sustainablesolutions-duke-energy-com-staging.go-vip.net/resources/evaluating-commercial-solar-roi-payback-irr-and-npv/"">ROI trend for solar </a>and specifically do you know why we are seeing an improvement in a payback curve for industrial installations?

<strong>Chris: </strong>This is my 16th year in the <a href=""https://sustainablesolutions-duke-energy-com-staging.go-vip.net/solutions/distributed-generation/solar-energy/"">solar industry in California</a>, let’s just say in the last 10 years, there’s been a lot of comings and goings of various tariffs on modules and there’s just a ton of noise in the market consistently. But the funny thing throughout all of that is that paybacks for solar still remain roughly a three to five-year payback, even though energy rates or solar might not be as good as what they were previously. We just had a 30% reduction in modules six months ago and, it’s like all the market forces are focused to keep solar roughly, you know, depending on your situation, somewhere in that zone of a three to five-year payback. Somewhere around fifteen to twenty percent rate of return. I think it’s consistent across the board.

<strong>Craig: </strong>And in some slots in California even better I’ve seen. Chris we are out of time. Thanks for your insight and advice and I think it is time for me to get my next cup of tea so if anyone would like to talk to Chris about your TOU shifts, feel free to send an email and you can also email us with other questions and we look forward to the next solar tea time which will be on the second Tuesday of every month. The second Tuesday of June will be our next session. We’ll send some topics just beforehand so on behalf of everyone at REC Solar, thanks. Cheers. Bye bye.",,,

8080,"Blue Lake Rancheria Native American Reservation Microgrid Goes Live",,"April 27, 2017 | Minnetonka, MN for immediate release
<h6>Microgrid powering critical infrastructure will save $200,000 per year, reduce 150 tons CO2 emissions annually and create clean energy jobs</h6>
<h6>Deployment represents industry-leading standard for collaboration between state, tribal, federal, and local entities, academia, technology providers, and utility partners</h6>
Blue Lake Rancheria, a century-old Native American reservation in Northern California, has launched its low-carbon community microgrid that is helping power government offices, economic enterprises, and critical Red Cross safety shelter-in place facilities across 100 acres. In collaboration with Humboldt State University's Schatz Energy Research Center, Siemens, Idaho National Laboratory and additional partners, the microgrid uses decentralized energy resources and intelligent software to provide its residents and economic enterprises with reliable power without interruption.

The microgrid includes a 500-kilowatt solar photovoltaic system designed and built by REC Solar and a 950 kWh Tesla battery storage system, all managed and controlled with Siemens Spectrum Power Microgrid Management System (MGMS) software. Funded in part through a $5 million grant from the California Energy Commission's Electric Program Investment Charge (EPIC) program, the system allows the reservation to operate independently of the power grid in coordination with local utility Pacific Gas &amp; Electric. This project incorporates the largest solar array in currently in operation in Humboldt County, California, is estimated to save the Tribe over $200,000 in annual energy costs, will reduce at least 150 tons of carbon per year and will grow Tribal clean energy jobs by 10 percent.

“With the help of our state, academic, technology, federal, and utility partners, this microgrid project has fulfilled the Tribe’s aggressive energy security, economic, and environmental goals,” said Jana Ganion, the Tribe’s Sustainability Director. “We have proven we can efficiently deploy the fiscally-responsible solar and storage sources of energy, create clean energy jobs, and transition away from fossil fuels at a brisk and feasible pace.”

“At its core, this microgrid is an example of motivated governments investing in distributed grid improvements and low-carbon energy in a novel and replicable way,” said Arla Ramsey, Blue Lake Rancheria’s Vice Chair. “Our partners have contributed their expertise and goodwill far above what we expected. This partnership approach has transformed our energy sector with significant employment and other economic co-benefits.”

“The Blue Lake Rancheria community is leading the way in their commitment to the environment,” said Alan Russo, senior vice president of sales and marketing at REC Solar. “We enjoyed working alongside a customer with shared values and a willingness to build such innovative energy solutions.”

“This project demonstrates how national laboratory assets can be leveraged as part of a diverse partnership to reduce risks and build resilient community microgrids,” said Rob Hovsapian, Power &amp; Energy Systems manager at Idaho National Laboratory.

“The continuing trend toward decentralized energy is made feasible in large part by the introduction of intelligent software to manage and control a vast array of energy resources,” said Pat Wilkinson, Vice President at Siemens Digital Grid. “With our intelligent microgrid management software, Blue Lake Rancheria is able to rely on a complex mix of generation and storage to work together to deliver efficient, reliable and cleaner power for the Tribe's government offices and other critical infrastructure.”

“The Blue Lake Rancheria has been a pioneer in bringing together a number of different energy technologies in one location through their microgrid,” said David Rubin, PG&amp;E’s Director of Service Analysis. “We have welcomed the opportunity to participate in this microgrid project because it showcases the use of multiple distributed energy resources while playing an important role in the community in the event of a natural disaster or another emergency.”

The software is able to accurately predict power needs and dynamically manage generation and distribution through integrated weather data, load forecasting, and load-shed scenarios. In grid-connected mode, the software will help the Tribe reduce peak loads and conduct other energy management optimization to help relieve pressures on the larger grid. In cases of emergency when the larger grid is down, the system will operate in islanded mode. In both scenarios, the software prioritizes the use of the cleanest and most financially beneficial forms of energy, in this case solar and battery storage, within a portfolio of on-site generation sources.

8084,"Duke Energy Renewables and REC Solar Announce the Completion of Their First Joint Microgrid Project with Schneider Electric",,"April 6, 2017 | Charlotte, NC for immediate release
<h6>REC Solar built the solar array for the Duke Energy Renewables-owned system, which is now operational. A second microgrid project is underway in Maryland.</h6>
Duke Energy Renewables today announced its first microgrid project is now operating on the Schneider Electric Boston One Campus.

<a href=""http://www.schneider-electric.us/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Schneider Electric</a> built the microgrid on the campus of its North American headquarters in Andover, Mass. REC Solar, a national provider of commercial solar and energy solutions, built and will operate the solar array.

Duke Energy Renewables, which owns a majority interest in REC Solar, owns the microgrid system and solar array and is selling the power to Schneider Electric through a long-term power purchase agreement.

""The integration of an advanced microgrid at the Schneider Electric campus reduces its energy costs, incorporates more sustainable energy and delivers demand-side efficiency, while also offering resiliency to the facility in the event of a loss of power from the grid,"" said Chris Fallon, vice president of Duke Energy Renewables and Commercial Portfolio. ""Additionally, in partnership with Schneider, we can research and develop new microgrid technologies, solutions and applications in a real-world environment.""

The microgrid is expected to generate more than 520,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity per year. It includes a 354-kilowatt (AC) solar array with 1,379 solar modules that power the system. The microgrid also incorporates a natural gas generator as an anchor resource, allowing the solar panels to operate during grid outages to maintain critical operations.

In addition to the Boston One site, Duke Energy Renewables, Schneider Electric and REC Solar have a second microgrid project underway for the Montgomery County, Maryland, Public Safety Headquarters and Correctional Facility.

Duke Energy Renewables will own the two Montgomery County microgrids, which will consist of a 2-megawatt (AC) solar project and two combined heat and power (CHP) units. The CHP systems will save energy by using waste heat from on-site power generation to heat and cool the buildings.

REC Solar will build and operate the solar facility, and Schneider Electric will design and implement the microgrid project, which is expected to become fully operational in 2018.

""It's more important than ever to meet customers' evolving needs through solutions that are creative, affordable and dependable,"" said Rob Caldwell, president, Duke Energy Renewables and Distributed Energy Technology. ""With more than 100 years of utility experience and an established renewables business, we bring the expertise in generating cleaner energy that will serve to increase the security and sustainability for these county facilities.""

""Island mode"" capabilities of the microgrids will allow continued operation of Montgomery County's critical facilities for extended periods during power outages.

The Montgomery County microgrids will produce approximately 3.3 million kilowatt-hours of solar energy and 7.4 million kilowatt-hours of CHP each year. Combined, the on-site power generation at these two facilities is anticipated to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 3,629 metric tons per year.

8030,"2 MW Solar Project Completed in Brattleboro, VT",,"<h6>October 8, 2014 | Battleboro, VT</h6>
<h6>First Project of its Size in Southeastern Vermont Will Produce 40% of Local Electricity</h6>
Less than five months since breaking ground on a new 2 MW solar project in Brattleboro, VT., Winstanley Enterprises was joined by development team members and supporters to officially mark the project’s completion.

Lieutenant Governor Phil Scott and State Representative Mollie Burke headlined a group of dignitaries joining Winstanley Enterprises, Integrated Solar, REC Solar, Green Mountain Power and supporters and advocates of renewable energy to celebrate this milestone.

The newly constructed solar array sits on a 12-acre parcel owned by Winstanley Enterprises, and is the first project of its size in southeastern Vermont. Over 8,000 ground-mounted photovoltaic panels comprise the 2 megawatt system which on a clear sunny day will produce 40% of Brattleboro’s electrical needs.

“It’s rewarding to realize that this project represents a significant step in Vermont’s bigger picture initiative to deliver clean renewable energy sources across the state,” said Adam Winstanley, a Principal of Winstanley Enterprises. “We are proud of our entire team’s efforts on this project, and applaud the state of Vermont for their unwavering commitment to the environment.”

The project was part of Vermont’s Sustainably Priced Energy Development (SPEED) Program, in which all of the renewable energy produced by the system will be purchased through a feed-in tariff. Vermont has established goals to meet 20% of electricity needs under the SPEED program resources by 2017; 75% of electricity from renewable sources by 2032; and 90% of energy needs across all sectors from renewable resources by 2050.

“I am very proud that we have more than quadrupled the amount of solar energy in Vermont since I became Governor, and today we build on that accomplishment by adding another 2 megawatts of solar to the grid,” Governor Peter Shumlin said. “This project and others like it have helped make Vermont number one in solar jobs per capita, and are contributing to a vibrant clean energy economy for Vermonters.”

The event featured an official ribbon cutting ceremony, a signing ceremony where each participant autographed a solar panel within the newly constructed array, and a presentation of a proclamation sent to the event by Vermont Governor Peter Shumlin. The event also had a speaking platform headlined by Lieutenant Governor Phil Scott.

“Renewable energy projects like this solar installation are a boon for our environment and our economy,” said Lt. Governor Phil Scott. “When we invest in projects that reduce our dependence on foreign oil, we grow opportunities for our skilled local workforce – and plant the seeds for Vermont to sustain itself, independent from outside influences. Today’s celebration is a win for our climate, a win for our workers, and a win for the Vermonters who will see savings as a result of this forward-thinking project.”

Integrated Solar, a Vermont renewable energy company, and REC Solar, a national solar solutions provider for commercial customers, constructed the project. REC Solar served as the lead contractor on the project while Integrated Solar installed the system.

Since breaking ground on May 15, 2014, the project has employed a local workforce in excess of 75 people with more than 18,000 labor hours.

“This project has driven home the significance of solar power to Brattleboro’s energy future through its visibility and local business involvement,” said Integrated Solar President Andy Cay.  “We are pleased to have been part in this successful collaborative effort with many local businesses and individuals together with a leading national solar company, REC Commercial.”

Making this project a local effort was a priority for Winstanley Enterprises from the start, and the blend of Integrated Solar and REC Solar’s efforts contributed greatly to the project’s overall success.

“The combination of our experience providing end-to-end solutions for a wide range of commercial solar projects and Integrated Solar’s strong local expertise enabled a smooth and successful project development and construction process,” said Mark Bettis, REC Solar VP of Sales and Marketing. “These partnerships are key to developing high-quality solar arrays on-time and on-budget and helping Vermont reach its clean energy goals.”

Aside from this development, Winstanley and the Brattleboro Memorial Hospital just announced an agreement to collaborate on the construction and operation of a separate 500 kilo-Watt net metered solar power array.[/fusion_text][fusion_text]
