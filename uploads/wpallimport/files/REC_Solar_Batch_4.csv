<h6>Montgomery County Executive Ike Leggett announced the official activation of two advanced microgrids for its Public Safety Headquarters (PSHQ) in Gaithersburg and Correctional Facility in Boyds on Wednesday, Oct. 24.</h6>
[/fusion_text][fusion_separator style_type=""single solid"" hide_on_mobile=""small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility"" class="""" id="""" sep_color="""" top_margin=""10"" bottom_margin=""30"" border_size="""" icon="""" icon_circle="""" icon_circle_color="""" width="""" alignment=""center"" /][fusion_text columns="""" column_min_width="""" column_spacing="""" rule_style=""default"" rule_size="""" rule_color="""" hide_on_mobile=""small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility"" class="""" id=""""]

The activation ceremony took place at 100 Edison Park Drive in Gaithersburg. The microgrids are on-site clean power generation systems, which permit both facilities to operate independently from the power grid to ensure continuity of operations in the event of a catastrophic storm or major power outage.

“Montgomery County is one of the first jurisdictions in the nation to incorporate resilient energy resources, enabling essential public facilities to be self-sufficient and reduce our overall carbon footprint,” said Leggett. “The Public Safety Headquarters and the Montgomery County Correctional Facility are essential to protecting our communities. The solar panels and other advanced systems added to these facilities will generate clean power and take stress off the power grid during extreme weather conditions and other emergencies.”

The completed project is provided through an <a href=""https://www2.montgomerycountymd.gov/mcgportalapps/Press_Detail.aspx?Item_ID=18742"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">innovative public-private partnership</a> with Schneider Electric and <a href=""https://recsolar.com/press/alex-crown-uc-davis-sustainable-energy/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Duke Energy Renewables</a> that required no upfront costs for the County. The on-site power generation at these two sites is anticipated to reduce greenhouse gas emissions equal to removing 1,400 cars from the road or planting 178,000 new trees.

The Montgomery County PSHQ microgrid also achieved Performance Excellence in Electricity Renewal (PEER) certification from <a href=""http://www.gbci.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Green Business Certification Inc.</a> (GBCI) and is the first Maryland project and public safety headquarters to earn certification. <a href=""http://peer.gbci.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">PEER</a> is the world’s first certification program that measures and improves power system performance and electricity infrastructure. Through certification, PEER recognizes industry leaders for improving efficiency and sustainability, day-to-day reliability and resilience in the face of severe events.

Officials joining Leggett at the activation event included, Montgomery County Council President Hans Riemer; Montgomery County Councilmembers Roger Berliner and Sidney Katz; Deputy Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency U.S. Department of Energy Kathleen Hogan; Director of the Maryland Energy Administration Mary Beth Tung; Montgomery County Department of General Services Director David Dise; Schneider Electric Senior Vice President Strategy, Business Development &amp; Government Relations Kevin Self; Vice President Duke Energy Renewables and Commercial Portfolio Chris Fallon; and Senior Vice President, U.S. Green Building Council David Witek; Pepco, Region Vice President, Maryland Affairs Jerry Pasternak.

Given the <a href=""https://www.schneider-electric.us/en/work/solutions/microgrids/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Schneider Electric</a> and <a href=""https://www.duke-energy.com/our-company/about-us/businesses/renewable-energy"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Duke Energy Renewables</a> public-private partnership (P3) made the project possible with no upfront capital costs, the County’s other budget priorities were not affected. As part of the agreement, Duke Energy Renewables will own and operate both microgrids with the assistance of its subsidiary, <a href=""/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">REC Solar</a>, and Schneider Electric. The two advanced microgrids will produce over 11 million kWh per year with solar and combined heat and power.

“This Microgrid project is a major benefit for Montgomery County and the entire National Capital Region,” said Riemer. “This P3 with Schneider Electric and Duke Energy Renewables ensures that our Public Safety Headquarters and Correctional Facility has continuity of critical services during power losses, reduces our carbon footprint, and saves our residents millions of dollars.”

The microgrids continue Montgomery County’s work of delivering superior government service with the smallest environmental footprint. Through energy efficiency, renewable energy investment and energy purchases, Montgomery County is a carbon-neutral government.

<h6>1.3 megawatt (DC) system built by REC Solar expected to produce $6.2 million in savings over 25 years</h6>
[/fusion_text][fusion_separator style_type=""single solid"" hide_on_mobile=""small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility"" class="""" id="""" sep_color="""" top_margin=""10"" bottom_margin=""30"" border_size="""" icon="""" icon_circle="""" icon_circle_color="""" width="""" alignment=""center"" /][fusion_text]Taft Union High School District will break ground this summer on a solar project that will generate renewable energy, reduce greenhouse gases and save millions of dollars.

The system will be designed and built by REC Solar, a leading provider of commercial, public sector and utility-scale solar solutions. Sage Renewable Energy Consulting, Inc., an independent energy consulting firm, was retained by the district to help guide the vendor selection process and ensure that district goals are met from design through implementation.

The 1.3 megawatt system includes a 1.1 megawatt ground mount system adjacent to Taft Union High School and a nearly 200-kilowatt carport in the Buena Vista High School parking lot. Combined, the system will contain about 3,750 individual solar panels with an annual production capacity of 2,160,000 kilowatt hours. It will offset 76% of the energy used at Taft Union High School and 97% of the energy at Buena Vista High School. Over a 25-year period, the system is expected to save the district $6.2 million and reduce carbon emissions by more than 35,000 metric tons.

As part of the project, REC Solar will be updating the PG&amp;E service sub-station for Taft Union High School.

“This project has a wide range of benefits for our schools,” said Blanca Cavazos, superintendent at Taft Union High School District. “We are saving millions on energy costs, providing shaded parking spots with the carport and taking advantage of our frequent sunshine to power our facilities with renewable energy.”

“We are excited to be producing nearly all the energy needed at Taft and Buena Vista High Schools,” said Alan Russo, senior vice president of Sales and Marketing at REC Solar. “The long-term savings can be leveraged by the schools for other important investments over the next 25 years.”[/fusion_text][fusion_text]

REC Solar was ranked the 8<sup>th</sup> largest commercial solar provider in the United States in the 2017 Solar Power World Top 500 Solar Contractors List.

The Top Solar Contractors list is developed by Solar Power World to recognize the work completed by solar contractors across the United States. Produced annually, the Top Solar Contractors list celebrates the achievements of U.S. solar developers, subcontractors and installers within the utility, commercial and residential markets. The list was released on July 25.

“The 2017 Top Solar Contractors list features 500 of the best solar contractors in the United States,” said Kelly Pickerel, managing editor of Solar Power World. “From solar hotbeds on the coasts to the up-and-coming Midwest solar market, every installer adding even the smallest solar array to the grid is making a positive impact on our communities. We’re proud to recognize these companies and their efforts to bring solar power to U.S. homes and businesses.”

The U.S. solar market installed more than 14,700 MW of solar in 2016, nearly doubling the capacity installed in 2015. For the first time ever, solar was ranked as the No. 1 source of new electric generating capacity additions brought online throughout the year. GTM Research and the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) predict the cumulative U.S. solar market to nearly triple in size over the next five years. By 2022, more than 18 GW of solar photovoltaic capacity will be installed annually, and REC Solar will continue to be a major player in adding solar to the grid.

Throughout the last year, REC Solar built 75.7 megawatts of commercial solar projects in states that included California, Hawaii, Texas, Nevada, New Jersey and Arizona. Since the company was founded in 1997, REC Solar has built over 260 megawatts of commercial projects.

“Our continued growth has been driven by customers who want to get the greatest value possible from their solar investments,” said Alan Russo, senior vice president of sales and marketing at REC Solar. “Whether we are integrating solar and energy storage, troubleshooting a unique site requirement or analyzing a portfolio of projects, we bring a unique level of expertise and passion to our clients that leads to better results.”

The 517-kw rooftop system was designed and built by REC Solar, a California-based provider of commercial, public sector and utility-scale solar solutions. It generates 827,000 kilowatt hours of electricity annually, enough to power 60 homes for a year. The system will provide about 80 percent of the energy needed for the facility and is expected to save more than $4 million over the next 30 years.

“This year Riboli Family Wine Estates is celebrating our 100th year producing wine. The solar system and other sustainability measures at our newest facility in Paso Robles are perfect examples of the continued innovation that has helped make our business successful,” said fourth-generation family winemaker Anthony Riboli.

“We are blessed to work in a beautiful area with a climate that provides us with plenty of sunshine. Using that sun to generate our own renewable power on our rooftop is a huge win. It empowers us to minimize our impact on the environment, create more predictable costs and produce incredible wine in our sustainable, modern facility,” said Riboli.

The rooftop project uses 1,520 panels across approximately 100,000 square feet of roof space, making it one of the largest rooftop solar projects for a winery on the Central Coast. The solar is on the roof of the production facility and will power both the wine operations and the adjacent hospitality center.

“The entire Paso Robles facility is an incredible showcase for San Antonio Winery’s investment in the environment, the community and great wine,” said Alan Russo, senior vice president of sales and marketing at REC Solar. “We are proud to have partnered with them on this solar energy initiative.”[/fusion_text][fusion_text]

<a href=""https://recsolar.com"">REC Solar</a>, a leading provider of commercial, public sector and utility-scale solar solutions, has been ranked by Pacific Business News (PBN) Research as the largest solar company in Hawaii by 2016 total kilowatts installed. The total amount of solar installed in Hawaii throughout 2016 by REC Solar was 52.5 megawatts (MW) DC.

“In 2016, the solar landscape in Hawaii saw substantial changes, such as the transition from customer grid-supply to customer self-supply programs,” said Drew Bradley, regional manager of REC Solar in Hawaii. “Our success is a result of our ability to partner on large, utility-scale projects and to deliver financially viable solar and energy storage solutions for commercial customers.”

Among the most significant projects REC Solar completed in 2016 was the Eurus Waianae Solar Project, a 27.6 megawatt (MW) AC, 40.5 megawatt (MW) DC farm on Oahu’s west side, and the largest solar project ever built in Hawaii. The utility-scale project, whose yearly energy output is equivalent to the electricity used by 11,000 homes, is owned and operated by Eurus Energy, an independent power producer and global developer of utility-scale wind and solar projects.

During 2016, REC Solar completed 15 projects for non-profit, hospitality, <a href=""https://recsolar.com/agriculture-solar-solutions/"">agricultural</a> and other private sector customers.

“We are thrilled to be bringing sustainable power to the islands and to be once again recognized as the top solar provider,” said Matt Walz, CEO of REC Solar.

Since entering the Hawaii market in 2007, REC Solar has installed 78 systems totaling 83 megawatts for recognizable Hawaii-based customers like Kaua‘i Island Utility Cooperative, Turtle Bay Resort, Enterprise Rent-A-Car and Dole Plantation.

<a href=""https://recsolar.com/"">REC Solar</a>, a leading provider of commercial solar and energy solutions, announced today, in conjunction with <a href=""http://www.taylorfarms.com/"">Taylor Farms</a>, that it surpassed 100 installations for the agriculture sector. To reach this milestone, REC Solar and Taylor Farms, the leading producer of value-added produce in North America, completed a 1 megawatt (MW) project in Gonzales, California. This installation is part of Taylor Farms’ commitment to investing in renewable energy sources across the country.

REC Solar’s agriculture sector installations account for 45 MW of the company’s installed total of over 200 MW. Over the past 19 years, REC Solar has helped approximately 70 businesses in the agricultural sector, including growers, vineyards, nurseries, food and beverage processors and cold storage facilities, to manage energy costs and improve long-term business stability with clean solar energy.

This latest Taylor Farms system in Gonzales, California coupled with its existing wind turbine can offset more than 25 percent of that facility’s energy consumption during peak periods. REC Solar previously completed a solar project for Taylor Farms in Salinas, California, and is working with the company on additional projects for facilities in Tracy, California and Dallas, Texas.

“Taylor Farms is a leader in the agriculture industry, and now in sustainability, because we know it’s the right thing to do,” said Nicole Flewell, director of sustainability at Taylor Farms. “Not only are we taking care of the environment but we’re also providing ourselves with reliable and cost effective energy sources.”

“Over the last 15 years, some of our most innovative solar solutions have been developed for members of the agriculture community. Farmers were some of the earliest adopters of solar because they quickly saw the business and environmental benefits,” said Alan Russo, senior vice president of sales and marketing at REC Solar. “We are proud of the work we are doing to help such a critically important industry thrive in California, Hawaii and across the nation.”

<h6>Hawaii's mandate to achieve 100% clean energy by 2045 places the state at the forefront of solar and renewable energy adoption in the United States. Since 2007, REC Solar has been a leader in commercial solar on the islands. Recently, the solar landscape in Hawaii has seen several changes that include the end of the energy buyback program, meaning solar customers can no longer sell excess power back to the utility.</h6>
[/fusion_text][fusion_text]To answer questions about the latest energy policies and trends in Hawaii, REC Solar recently hosted our inaugural Solar Innovation event in Honolulu. Attendees included a mix of business leaders, representatives from Hawaiian Electric (HECO), energy policy experts, battery storage companies and others in the energy ecosystem.

We had three expert moderators leading our discussions: <strong>Brody McMurtry</strong> (Business Development Manager of Energy Solutions Group for Johnson Controls, Inc.) focused on the topic of energy storage, <strong>Erik Kvam</strong> (Managing Director of Hawaii Energy Law Services and Director of REACH) explained the latest updates in Hawaii energy policy, and<strong> Drew Bradley</strong> (Director of Business Development for REC Solar) discussed the newest “Solar plus Storage” PPA offerings, as well as other financing options for commercial solar.

<strong>ENERGY LAWS AND UTILITY POLICIES</strong>
<ol>
 	<li>A proposed Energy Storage Tax Credit bill would provide additional opportunities for cost savings, as well as contributing to the necessary policy shifts needed to achieve 100% renewables by 2045. Business owners and local energy partners are encouraged to consider joining REACH (Renewable Energy Action Committee Hawaii) in order to support the advocacy of bills that would support solar and other renewable energy.</li>
 	<li>Three Hawaiian Electric Company (HECO) representatives were present for the discussion, and they shared some insight into the current state of the utility and what they are planning for the future. These goals include creating a model to value solar/exported power, completing a pilot test for time-of-use (TOU) rates, installation of smart meters, adding demand response capabilities, and distributed energy storage.</li>
</ol>

<strong>SAVING MONEY WITH SOLAR AND STORAGE</strong>
<ol>
 	<li>Despite the end of energy buyback programs like net metering and customer grid supply, there are still a number of opportunities for businesses to cut costs by going solar, including:
<ul>
 	<li>Commercial Standard Interconnection Agreement (SIA)</li>
 	<li>PV + Storage</li>
 	<li>Microgrids</li>
 	<li>Federal Investment tax credit (ITC) &amp; state tax credit</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Storage can reduce energy costs for businesses, either in conjunction with PV or in some cases, even on its own.
<ul>
 	<li>Energy storage can help balance the load or maximize the advantages of time-of-use (TOU) rates. This is especially important for businesses that require high energy usage during peak hours because it allows you to save the energy generated in off-peak hours to use later when the rates would be much higher. Even without PV, this makes sense for anywhere that has a peak hour upcharge of $0.10/kWh or more.</li>
 	<li>Storage also provides UPS (uninterruptable power supply) as energy security for businesses/industries that require large quantities of reliable power, like hospitals, military bases, data centers, and critical infrastructure like water and heat.</li>
 	<li>Additional ways to lower energy costs through the use of storage include demand reduction, demand response (where available), frequency response, and power factor correction</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>There are several financing options currently available for solar and/or storage customers:
<ul>
 	<li>Commercial solar can be financed through a standard Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), lease, or cash deal.</li>
 	<li>Storage projects can be purchased with cash, or with “Storage as a Service” financing, which is similar to PPA models in that the customer pays a fixed monthly fee for the savings generated by the storage system but all the risk can be put on the battery technology provider. Storage can also be purchased via shared savings models where the customer and provider both get a percentage of the savings generated by the storage.</li>
 	<li>For projects that will incorporate both solar and storage, there may be a “Solar plus Storage” PPA opportunity. This option provides solar energy generation and battery storage at a fixed cost per unit of power produced by the solar, while all project development and maintenance costs remain as the responsibility of the solar and storage providers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>JCI and REC Solar have already partnered on solar plus storage projects in the islands. This partnership is beneficial to customers because it allows them to combine the energy savings from both technologies into a package that can be financed, installed, and maintained under a single contract.</li>
</ol>

&nbsp;

<strong>RESOURCES FOR BUSINESS OWNERS</strong>
<ol>
 	<li>What should a customer know before selecting a solar provider?
<ul>
 	<li>Get help understanding your utility rates and energy bills – many business owners pay hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in energy costs without ever analyzing at their bill from the utility.</li>
 	<li>Recognize the importance of system design experts; solar is not a one-size-fits-all solution, so make sure you are selecting a provider with a proven track record to help customize your energy system.</li>
 	<li>Utilize a legal expert to better understand financing options, contracts, and tax incentives.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>What should a customer know before selecting a storage technology provider?
<ul>
 	<li>Research legislation and tax credits that may help to lower the cost of storage</li>
 	<li>Make sure you select a storage provider with extensive knowledge and experience to ensure that you get the best storage system for your business and that it is properly installed and maintained to maximize your ROI</li>
 	<li>Choose a reliable manufacturer with a large balance sheet - the performance guarantees and warranties for your batteries are only effective if the manufacturer is still in business!</li>
</ul>

[/fusion_text][fusion_separator style_type=""single solid"" hide_on_mobile=""small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility"" class="""" id="""" sep_color="""" top_margin=""10"" bottom_margin=""30"" border_size="""" icon="""" icon_circle="""" icon_circle_color="""" width="""" alignment=""center"" /][fusion_text]

<a href=""https://recsolar.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">REC Solar</a>, a leading provider of commercial solar and energy solutions, today announced that it completed the installation of 27.6 megawatts (MW) of solar at the Eurus Waianae Solar Project. The utility-scale project, whose yearly energy output is equivalent to the electricity used by 11,000 homes, is owned and operated by Eurus Energy, an independent power producer and global developer of utility scale wind and solar projects.

The Eurus Waianae Solar Project is the largest solar installation in the state and a significant step toward Hawaii achieving its ambitious goal of operating on 100 percent renewable energy by 2045.

“In addition to the cost savings and energy generating benefits, this system demonstrates Hawaii’s commitment to a clean energy future,” said Satoshi Takahata, President and CEO of Eurus Energy America at Eurus Energy America. “REC Solar was a key partner in this project and we are excited to see the completed system generating renewable energy for the island.”

Built on 200 acres in West Oahu, the Eurus Waianae Solar Project sells its energy to Hawaiian Electric Company, Inc. under a 22-year PPA and at approximately 14.5 cents per kilowatt-hour, making it one of Hawaii’s lowest-cost renewable energy projects.

“The Eurus Waianae project is the latest in our growing list of large ground-mount solar arrays in Hawaii,” said Matt Walz, CEO of REC Solar. “The successful completion of this project, in addition to our 5MW Aloha Solar and 12MW KIUC Anahola installations, shows our ability to meet unique customer site requirements, work alongside partners and manage the changing Hawaii regulatory requirements.”

REC Solar provided procurement, construction and project management under an engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) agreement executed with the Eurus affiliate, EE Waianae Solar Project LLC. The project deployed trackers from Exosun, a supplier of advanced solar tracking solutions for ground-mounted photovoltaic (PV) plants, to maximize the system’s energy output.

REC Solar is the largest commercial solar provider in Hawaii. The company’s customers include Dole Plantation, Enterprise Rent-A-Car, Longs Drugs, Public Storage, Safeway and Turtle Bay Resort. Additionally, the company recently completed a 60-acre, 12MW solar farm for the Kauai Island Utility Cooperative that generates 5 percent of the island’s energy needs.

The U.S. Army Reserve (USAR) and REC Solar, a national provider of <a href=""https://recsolar.com/"">commercial solar and energy solutions</a>, today announced the interconnection of two solar energy carports totaling 280 kW at USAR offices in Arizona and California. The solar arrays support the Department of Defense’s (DoD) mandate of procuring 25 percent of its total facility energy from renewable sources by 2025 (National Defense Authorization Act of 2010: Section 2842).

REC Solar provided the engineering, procurement and construction services for the solar carport installations. Federal Prison Industries (FPI), a U.S. government corporation, was the contracting agency and provided the system modules.

“REC Solar’s track record of installing high-quality solar energy systems for government agencies gave us the confidence that REC would complete this project right and on time,” said Stewart Fearon, Director of Public Works for the 63rd Regional Support Command, U.S. Army Reserve. “By working with REC Solar and Federal Prison Industries, these solar projects provide dependable renewable energy for the long term. We’re also pleased to provide quality, meaningful jobs for the 21st century that can help rehabilitate inmates.”

Under FPI oversight, inmates from the federal prison system engaged in high-skill jobs manufacturing the solar modules, which are incorporated into federal solar arrays. USAR’s solar carports will provide shading for employee and soldier parking, and offset carbon emissions equivalent to burning 521 barrels of oil annually.

“I saw first-hand that we need to produce energy at home during my tour in Iraq,” said John Handy, Federal Business Development Manager at REC Solar and retired U.S. Army Colonel. “Solar energy is a proven solution that can generate energy at home as reliably as the sun rising every day. REC Solar is proud to help the Department of Defense contribute to U.S. energy independence with these two new solar installations.”

REC Solar is a leading provider of <a href=""https://recsolar.com/government-solar-projects"">solar energy solutions for federal agencies</a>. REC Solar now counts more than 32 MW across 35 federal projects, including VA Tucson, FAA TRACON and VA West Los Angeles. Backed by Duke Energy, one of the largest energy companies in the world, REC Solar provides high-quality solar energy systems for federal agencies that need systems to stand the test of time.

<h6>12 MW Solar System to Generate 5% of Kauai's Energy Needs</h6>
[/fusion_text][fusion_separator style_type=""single solid"" hide_on_mobile=""small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility"" class="""" id="""" sep_color="""" top_margin=""10"" bottom_margin=""30"" border_size="""" icon="""" icon_circle="""" icon_circle_color="""" width="""" alignment=""center"" /][fusion_text]

REC Solar, a national leader in commercial solar and energy solutions, today announced the interconnection of a 12 MW AC (14.5 MW DC) solar array for Kaua‘i Island Utility Cooperative (KIUC). The utility-scale system is the largest in the state of Hawaii and REC Solar’s largest project to date.

Located in Anahola, Kaua‘i, the 60-acre PV system will generate twenty percent of the island’s annual energy needs during the daylight hours. The installation is coupled with a six megawatt lithium-ion battery system designed to smooth the integration of solar power on the grid. By generating clean energy on the island, KIUC will decrease fossil fuel imports from the mainland and save nearly $250,000 a month on operating costs alone.

A blessing and dedication ceremony will be held on November 7, 2015 to celebrate the interconnection of the record-setting array to the grid. KIUC president and CEO David Bissell and REC Solar CEO Al Bucknam will participate in the ceremony, which will include public tours of the solar farm.

“This project represents a huge step toward achieving our goal of using renewable resources to generate at least half of Kauai’s power needs by 2023,” Bissell said. “Every megawatt we can generate using the power of the sun reduces our costs and our greenhouse gas emissions.”

KIUC used project capital from the United States Department of Agriculture’s Rural Utilities Service to finance the Anahola project. The array is the second system that REC Solar has developed on Kauai. Additional REC Solar projects in Hawaii include the W.M. Keck Observatory, Turtle Bay Resort, Waimea WWTP and West Hawaii Civic Center. Most recently, REC Solar installed its fifth ground mount solar energy system for the islands’ largest tourist attraction, Dole Plantation, on Oahu.

“Hawaii is at the forefront of the electric grid transformation and solar energy is in the driver’s seat,” said Al Bucknam, REC Solar CEO. “REC has invested in understanding Hawaii’s unique market because we know commercial and utility-scale solar is an integral part of Hawaii’s ambitious 100 percent renewables goal.”

“REC Solar has more than eight years of experience in the Hawaii islands and we’ve completed more than 32 megawatts of commercial and utility projects here,” said Drew Bradley, Hawaii Regional Manager at REC Solar. “This installation is a game-changer for Kaua’i and will set a precedent for utility cooperatives across the U.S.”

Pacific Business News named REC Solar the <a href=""https://recsolar.com/hawaii"">leading solar company in Hawaii</a> by 2014 revenue. The company also ranked in the top five solar companies for job growth and kilowatts installed on the islands.

<a href=""https://recsolar.com/"">REC Solar</a>, a national provider of commercial solar and energy solutions, today announced the interconnection of a 1 MW solar energy system for <a href=""https://www.windsetfarms.com/"">Windset Farms®</a>. The Santa Barbara County farm is the largest in Santa Maria and grows non-GMO produce year-round in its state-of-the-art greenhouse facility. The roof-mounted array will enable the farm to run on clean energy, further enhancing its sustainable operations. This installation adds to REC Solar’s portfolio of over three dozen farms and food and beverage facilities in California.

“REC Solar is the clear leader in helping California farms go solar, and deciding to work with them was an easy decision,” said David Wesley, Director of Projects at Windset Farms®. “They helped us overcome some unique construction challenges, like high winds and site access restrictions. To top it off, the system was easy to finance and helped us save money on our energy bills immediately.”

REC Solar installed the 4,032-panel array on the roof of the farm’s shipping and packing building. The system was designed to accelerate the farm’s return on investment by maximizing energy production and offsetting consumption when utility electricity rates are highest. To achieve this goal, REC Solar installed a custom racking system combining flush-mounted panels on the western roof face and southern-tilted panels on the eastern roof face to receive optimal sun exposure. The racking system does not penetrate the roof, which will minimize long-term maintenance costs.

“REC makes it easy for farms to go solar because we cater to their specific business operations and ensure minimal disruptions. Since we work with our customers from start to finish, we can provide tailored financing, design and O&amp;M options that help each business meet its energy savings targets,” said Ryan Park, Director of Business Development at REC Solar. “Windset Farms is already a clear leader in cutting-edge technology and sustainability practices, and we’re pleased to help them to extend their leadership even further.”

Windset Farms® is a leader in deploying cutting-edge sustainable technology, including but not limited to water and CO2 recycling, an Integrated Pest Management system, heat-loss prevention screens and efficient land use. The family-run 128-acre facility in Santa Maria grows many varieties of tomatoes and cucumbers for leading national retailers.

The farm will host a ribbon cutting ceremony for their new solar installation on Tuesday, August 18 at 2 p.m.

In addition to Windset Farms, REC Solar has installed solar systems for large and small growers throughout the state, including Pandol, Vignolo Farms, Castlerock Vineyards, Delano Growers, Peter Rabbit Farms and Amaral Ranches. The company recently acquired Stellar Energy and expanded operations in the agricultural market, adding more than 10 wineries and farms to their portfolio. With financial backing from one of the largest energy companies in the world, REC Solar offers a streamlined PPA that simplifies the financing process to help farms and other businesses go solar with no money down.

REC Solar today announced it has acquired Stellar Energy, a leading solar provider in the western U.S., through an asset purchase agreement. REC Solar, the only national, fully integrated solar provider focused exclusively on commercial businesses and backed by one of the largest energy companies in the U.S., will provide customers with integrated, turnkey solar solutions ranging from financing and design to operations and maintenance.

This agreement strengthens REC Solar by expanding its sales and operations capabilities to better meet the needs of the U.S. solar market. REC Solar will continue to focus on providing solar solutions exclusively to the commercial market, including the agricultural, manufacturing, retail, technology, nonprofit and government sectors.

As a result of the deal, REC Solar will add more than 60 megawatts from 62 solar projects, bringing its portfolio to over 200 megawatts, installed or under construction. REC also picks up an additional 28 megawatts of operations and maintenance contracts, increasing the company’s O&amp;M portfolio to more than 200 megawatts as well.

“With nearly two decades of experience working with commercial customers, REC Solar has a unique understanding of how to tailor solar solutions to meet the needs of businesses,” said Al Bucknam, CEO of REC Solar. “By enhancing this expertise with Stellar’s team and streamlined customer financing through our partnership with Duke Energy, we’re helping more customers go solar with no money down and immediate energy savings. Our goal is to provide a competitive advantage for our clients while they focus on their core business.”

New clients joining the REC Solar portfolio include many global leaders in the agriculture, food &amp; beverage, manufacturing, mining &amp; energy and entertainment industries, as well as school districts and municipalities.

“We are excited about the breadth of resources REC Solar will bring our clients and our team,” said Stellar Energy president, Ted Walsh. “By combining our complementary services and strong customer relationships, we now have the resources to serve our customers with a fully integrated offering.”

REC Solar will retain most of Stellar Energy’s personnel to ensure a seamless transition for Stellar’s customers. Stellar Energy president Ted Walsh, who led the company’s successful expansion, will join REC Solar as Vice President of Business Development.

The transaction was completed with the parent company of Stellar Energy, Soligent Holdings.

Duke Energy, the nation’s largest electric utility, <a href=""https://recsolar.com/press/duke-energy-and-rec-solar/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">acquired a majority interest in REC Solar in February, 2015</a>, to better equip REC Solar to expand its offerings to commercial customers and extend the benefits of clean, cost-efficient distributed energy solutions to small and medium-sized businesses nationwide.

<h6>Commercial Solar Leader’s O&amp;M Portfolio Grew 1200% Over Past Five Years</h6>
[/fusion_text][fusion_separator style_type=""single solid"" hide_on_mobile=""small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility"" class="""" id="""" sep_color="""" top_margin=""10"" bottom_margin=""30"" border_size="""" icon="""" icon_circle="""" icon_circle_color="""" width="""" alignment=""center"" /][fusion_text]

REC Solar, a solar solutions provider and energy partner for businesses, today announced that its <a href=""https://recsolar.com/operations-maintenance"">operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) business</a> has surpassed 175 MW under contract. This milestone represents a 12-fold increase in O&amp;M business since 2009 and reflects surging market demand for high-quality end-to-end solar solutions that ensure ongoing solar performance.

In addition to providing O&amp;M for its existing solar customers, REC Solar was one of the first companies to serve projects built by other solar developers. By complying with a range of technical standards, REC Solar can provide O&amp;M services for complex systems that many other companies have steered away from. Recent O&amp;M deals include a 13 MW system in California where existing tracking technology required a more robust solution.

“More and more solar customers are learning that ongoing operations and maintenance is a critical part of REC Solar’s high-quality end-to-end solar solutions,” said Al Bucknam, REC Solar CEO. “Over nearly seventeen years of developing, installing and maintaining more than 400 commercial systems, REC Solar has developed a wealth of best practices to help everyone from national retailers to family farms get more out of their systems.”

“REC Solar’s high-quality services help customers maintain, and even increase, the value of their PV systems over time. For example, we recently boosted the performance of a customer’s five-year old 10 MW rooftop portfolio above levels achieved even at the very beginning of the system’s lifespan,” said Mike Borger, Senior Portfolio Manager at REC Solar. “These returns are gaining notice across the market, as much of our strong growth has come from becoming ‘foster parents’ to systems built by other contractors.”

REC Solar’s O&amp;M division achieves performance increases by evaluating historic performance, modeling performance, leading a detailed review of underperformance events and developing mitigation plans. This methodology has helped customers consistently exceed projections for energy production and availability.

According to GTM Research, the global market for O&amp;M will exceed 88 GW by the end of 2014, and is expected to nearly triple by 2018.

<h6>Puerto Rican Food Distributor Slashes Electricity Costs with Solar Electric System</h6>
[/fusion_text][fusion_separator style_type=""single solid"" hide_on_mobile=""small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility"" class="""" id="""" sep_color="""" top_margin=""10"" bottom_margin=""30"" border_size="""" icon="""" icon_circle="""" icon_circle_color="""" width="""" alignment=""center"" /][fusion_text]

Yarotek, a Miami-based solar developer and independent power producer with regional headquarters in San Juan, and REC Solar, a national provider of comprehensive commercial solar and energy solutions, today announced the completion of an 874 kilowatt solar array for Ballester Hermanos Inc., a food, wine, spirits and foodservice distributor in Dorado, Puerto Rico. The roof-mounted array will reduce electricity costs for the distribution warehouse, starting with projected savings of over $100k in 2015 and up to $200k per year by 2040.

Partnering with REC Solar for the installation, operation and maintenance of the system, Yarotek provided a solar Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) to Ballester Hermanos Inc. that will enable the distributor to save more than 40% on its electric bill with no upfront cost. Over the 25-year financing agreement, the solar installation is expected to save Ballester Hermanos millions of dollars.

The PV system, one of Puerto Rico’s largest commercial rooftop projects to date, is comprised of over 2,500 highly efficient SunPower photovoltaic modules. The system was awarded a rebate from the Puerto Rico Green Energy, and also qualifies for the United States federal tax credits. The new solar array will be celebrated at an inauguration event in Condado, Puerto Rico, on March 26 from 6:00 PM-8:00 PM.

“We are always looking for ways to be socially responsible, reduce our operating expenses and increase profits, but previously thought that solar was out of reach,” said Alejandro Ballester, President of Ballester Hermanos. “When we learned that a Power Purchase Agreement would deliver savings of over $100K per year with no upfront costs, going solar became a no-brainer.”

“Businesses in Puerto Rico face much higher electricity rates than those in the rest of the United States,” said Ben Collinwood, Director of National Accounts for REC Solar. “REC Solar specializes in making solar energy affordable for businesses like Ballester Hermanos by offering end-to-end service that dramatically reduces monthly costs.”

With hurricane season bringing torrential rains and winds of up to 150 mph in Puerto Rico, solar providers must design and construct systems to withstand severe weather conditions. REC Solar’s experienced engineers and installers conducted comprehensive site assessments to ensure the warehouse roof and racking solution met Puerto Rico’s strict building codes.

“We are very excited and proud of our Ballester Hermanos facility. Initially, Yarotek targeted almost exclusively the utility-scale clean-tech segment. Today, by harvesting the abundant solar resource, Yarotek has become a proven partner in the development and financing of distributed generation solar projects in the US and the Caribbean,” said Samy Esayag, Chief Executive Officer of Yarotek.

REC Solar, a U.S. commercial solar provider, has been ranked by PBN Research as the leading solar company in Hawaii by 2014 revenue. The company completed 14 commercial solar projects in Hawaii last year, accounting for nearly $55 million in revenue.

“We’re proud to have built a reputation in Hawaii as a reliable partner for business owners seeking to cut energy costs and lock in long-term low energy rates,” said REC Solar Hawaii Regional Manager, Drew Bradley. “The Hawaiian Islands are leading the way for renewables and we’re certain that REC Solar will have a major hand in helping the community reach its goal of 100 percent renewables by 2045.”

REC Solar also ranked in the top five solar companies for job growth and kilowatts installed on the islands, with 135 employees and over 19 megawatts installed or under development in 2014. The company is backed by one of the largest utility companies in the world and offers a unique streamlined PPA that simplifies the financing process to help businesses in Hawaii and nationwide go solar with no money down.

REC Solar was contracted to design and construct the largest solar PV installation in the Hawaiian Islands at 14.54 megawatt DC. The 60-acre PV system broke ground in June 2014 and is scheduled to interconnect to Kaua‘i Island Utility Cooperative (KIUC) in August 2015. The array will be the largest solar electric system in the State of Hawaii by DC wattage, generating enough clean energy to meet five percent of Kaua‘i’s annual energy needs.

Since entering the Hawaii market in 2007, REC Solar has installed 60 systems totaling 31 megawatts. In 2014, REC Solar completed four ground-mount solar energy systems for Hawaii’s Dole Plantation located in Oahu. The company is installing an additional 460 kilowatt system on the site, which will break ground on Monday, July 20, 2015.
“Our market leadership is a direct result of our focus on providing comprehensive solar services designed specifically for businesses, from project development and financing to construction and maintenance,” said Bradley.
REC Solar has delivered solar electric systems for many additional Hawaii-based businesses including Turtle Bay Resort, Enterprise Rent-A-Car and EK Fernandez Fun Factory. REC Solar continues to work with retailers, grocers, farmers, hotels and local businesses, and is planning additional projects.

“As the state with the highest level of solar penetration in its electricity market, Hawaii provides a useful illustration of how much running room there is for solar in the U.S.,” said Pavel Molchanov, energy analyst at Raymond James &amp; Associates. “Despite some grid saturation challenges, the mainstreaming of solar should continue. Hawaii’s newly enacted target of 100 percent renewables by 2040 is the most ambitious renewable portfolio standard of any U.S. state.”

In total, the top five largest solar companies in Hawaii generated nearly 800 jobs and $151 million in revenue in 2014.

<h6>Hotel Reduces Cooling Costs 44% with Solar Electric System</h6>
[/fusion_text][fusion_separator style_type=""single solid"" hide_on_mobile=""small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility"" class="""" id="""" sep_color="""" top_margin=""10"" bottom_margin=""30"" border_size="""" icon="""" icon_circle="""" icon_circle_color="""" width="""" alignment=""center"" /][fusion_text]

<a href=""https://recsolar.com/"">REC Solar</a>, a national leader in commercial solar electric system design and installation, today announced it has completed a 102 kilowatt array for <a href=""http://hamptoninn3.hilton.com/en/hotels/california/hampton-inn-and-suites-bakersfield-north-airport-BKRAPHX/index.html"">The Hampton Inn &amp; Suites Bakersfield North-Airport</a>, a subsidiary of Hilton Hotels (NYSE: HLT), in Bakersfield, California. The carport-mounted installation will offset 44 percent of the electricity costs for the 94-room hotel, saving up to $8,800 per month. The installation reflects the company’s ongoing commitment to accelerating solar deployment with <a href=""https://recsolar.com/hospitality-hotels-solar-projects"">hospitality customers</a>.

“Solar never made sense for us in the past,” said Braxton Myers, Vice President of Operations for Blackstone Hospitality Group Inc, which provides property management for franchise hotels throughout the U.S. such as The Hampton Inn. “But REC Solar delivered a price point that convinced us to take another look. They walked us through a range of financing options and designed a tailored carport system which offered many benefits. REC Solar came highly recommended by their existing customers, and have delivered on that sterling reputation throughout this process.”

With temperatures regularly reaching 115 degrees, the Bakersfield hotel faces steep cooling costs. Because hotels must maintain comfortable temperatures for their guests at all times, they can be some of the largest consumers of natural resources in hot communities like Bakersfield.

The Hampton Inn had expressed concerns about installing a rooftop array that would require closing the top floor of rooms and forfeiting revenue. As a result, REC Solar worked with The Hampton Inn to design a solar carport that did not require disruption to existing operations. The carport not only generates clean electricity but will also provide much-needed shade for 30 parked cars. REC Solar utilized HelioScope software to design the system, reducing installation time and costs. In addition to the solar array, Hampton Inn installed two electric vehicle charging stations, with room for up to eight stations.

“Hotels can be ideal candidates for solar energy, but have traditionally faced roadblocks ranging from high costs to concerns around customer inconvenience,” said Mark Bettis, VP of Sales and Marketing for REC Solar. “REC specializes in tailoring systems specifically for the needs of these customers by cutting soft costs through our design software and building solar carports to avoid impact on customers. In addition to reducing costs, hotels are finding that sustainable initiatives such as solar energy and EV charging stations are becoming increasingly desirable amenities for their customers.”

The completion of both the solar array and the EV charging stations was marked by a ribbon-cutting ceremony on July 30, 2014.

[/fusion_text][fusion_separator style_type=""single solid"" hide_on_mobile=""small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility"" class="""" id="""" sep_color="""" top_margin=""10"" bottom_margin=""30"" border_size="""" icon="""" icon_circle="""" icon_circle_color="""" width="""" alignment=""center"" /][fusion_text]

REC Solar, a national leader in commercial solar electric system design and installation, today announced the completion of a 1 MW solar energy system for Vignolo Farms. Located in California’s San Joaquin Valley, Vignolo Farms will offset 75 percent of its energy use at its cold storage facility with the four-acre array while significantly reducing its carbon footprint.

The installation of the solar energy system is the capstone in the farm’s comprehensive sustainability portfolio, which includes on-site recycling of growing materials, drop irrigation to preserve water, and composting to enrich crops and reduce waste. Vignolo Farms, a third-generation, family-run farm that produces wine grapes and organic potatoes, is a leader in sustainable agricultural practices.

“Vignolo Farms knows that sustainability isn’t a marketing campaign, but a real business asset,” said Brett Dixon, president of Top Brass Marketing, the sales agent for all Vignolo Farms products. “We’ve seen a sharp uptick in customer demand for sustainable produce, so generating our own solar energy was a natural next move for us. REC Solar’s track record as an affordable and reliable installer for a range of California farms made the decision to go solar even easier. ”

REC Solar completed the installation on time and on budget, while working around the demands of a working farm. In addition to Vignolo Farms, REC Solar has installed solar systems for more than two-dozen large and small growers and cold storage facilities throughout the state. The roster includes Delano Growers, Peter Rabbit Farms and Amaral Ranches, many of which are family-owned farms in the Coachella and Imperial Valley regions.

“We’re working with a growing number of organic and sustainable farmers deploying solar energy not only out of a deep commitment to the land but also because of the clear business benefits,” said REC Solar Director of Business Development Ryan Park. “Vignolo Farms is setting an example for California farms who want to dramatically reduce their energy output and lead the way in sustainable agriculture.”

7960,"W. M. Keck Observatory and Duke Energy’s REC Solar Announce Completion of Major Sustainability Project in Hawaii",,"December 10th, 2020 | Charlotte, NC and Mauna Kea, Hawaii for immediate release
<h5>133-kW rooftop solar site is world’s largest commercial solar system installed at highest altitude</h5>
Duke Energy’s REC Solar and W. M. Keck Observatory have completed the world’s largest commercial solar system installed at the record-breaking altitude of 13,600 feet.

The rooftop solar project - located near the summit of Mauna Kea, a dormant volcano on the Big Island of Hawaii - will reduce Keck Observatory’s carbon footprint and lower its cost of energy.

<img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-7846"" src=""https://sustainablesolutions-duke-energy-com-staging.go-vip.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/keck-observatory_rooftop-solar.jpg"" alt=""keck observatory rooftop solar array"" width=""1200"" height=""743"" />

The solar photovoltaic (PV) system is located on the rooftop of Keck Observatory’s telescope facility, between the domes of the twin Keck I and Keck II – among the world’s largest optical and infrared telescopes. The system will annually produce 259.1 MWh of energy, which will reduce the observatory’s electric power needs by about 10-15% and eliminate 183 metric tons of carbon emissions.

“Incorporating renewable energy generators such as solar PV is important to Keck’s core values of stewardship and service. It will reduce our reliance on electricity derived mainly from fossil fuels, which underscores our efforts to be good stewards of the planet,” says project lead Mark Devenot, infrastructure specialist at Keck Observatory.

Hawaiian Electric approved operation of the PV system on Sept. 30, 2020. The system consists of a 133-kW photovoltaic array and 332 solar panels that are strategically placed on the unique 20,940-square-foot ballasted roof to avoid snow and ice fall from the domes, as well as high winds that occasionally occur a few times a year.

“One of the biggest challenges was attaching the PV array to this type of roof, which has no structural framework to anchor the system,” says Devenot.

To address this issue, the solar system was custom engineered for the unique ballasted roof design and to support high winds. The team also had to deal with working at high altitude, which averaged 40% less oxygen than at sea level.

“Incorporating rooftop solar at Keck Observatory has been a special experience for the REC Solar team due to the project’s focus on science, safety and innovation,” says Dan Alcombright, managing director, growth implementation at Duke Energy. “Our team remained respectful of land and wind limitations throughout construction and leveraged our local experience and detailed weather data to engineer solar with specialized mechanical attachments that can handle the wind gusts and climate of a Pacific island at high altitude. We’re pleased to be able to provide Keck with a viable energy solution that positively impacts both their organization and the environment.”

At high altitude, the panels will catch more photons and produce more energy than at sea-level locations. This is because sunlight atop Mauna Kea doesn’t have to travel through as much of the Earth’s atmosphere where the photons could be absorbed by something else. Having 40% less atmosphere, which is one of the reasons that makes Mauna Kea one of the best places on Earth to conduct astronomy, also makes for efficient solar energy generation.

REC Solar has developed more than 100 commercial and utility-scale solar projects across the Hawaiian Islands, including Keck Observatory’s Waimea headquarters in 2013. This new rooftop solar installation at Keck Observatory’s telescope facility on Mauna Kea provides a unique research opportunity for the team to gather data on how solar panels operate in a thinner atmosphere with a high UV index and under higher than average winds. The team will continue to monitor and analyze these conditions for future solar installations at high altitudes.

7966,"REC Solar and DHX-Dependable Hawaiian Express Announce Completion of Solar Microgrid Project",,"May 6th, 2020 | Charlotte, NC for immediate release
<h6>· Completion of first project phase provides reliability, savings and more to leading Hawaiian-based freight hauler</h6>
<h6>· New microgrid system combines solar and battery storage for a zero-emissions energy system with a backup power supply</h6>
Today, DHX – Dependable Hawaiian Express and REC Solar, an unregulated affiliate of Duke Energy, announce the completion of a solar microgrid solution designed to bring reliability, savings, zero-emissions generation and more to the leading Hawaiian-based freight company.

The vision for renewable generation combined with energy storage as a backup power supply came long before DHX opened its environmentally friendly facility in Honolulu last August.

“When your company’s first name is “dependable,” you better have a power system that is too,” said DHX President Brad Dechter. “Still, my commitment to going green isn’t just about reliable energy and saving money. I have a granddaughter who is 7, and it’s as much about saving the planet for her future. The key for me was finding the right expert.”

“DHX wanted an emissions-free solution that would complement their commitment to customer service and ensure business continuity – even during a power outage,” said Dan Alcombright, senior vice president of REC Solar. “Providing innovative, resilient, clean energy solutions to our customers is what we do best.”
<h4>About the project</h4>
REC Solar designed, engineered and installed 360 solar panels on the 76,000-square-foot (7,061 square meters) roof of DHX’s new warehouse and distribution center in Honolulu. Located on one side of the roof, the 133-kW solar photovoltaic (PV) system eliminates 152 metric tons of CO2 emissions annually – that’s equivalent to removing about 33 passenger cars from the road for a year.

<img class=""size-full wp-image-6998 alignnone"" src=""https://sustainablesolutions-duke-energy-com-staging.go-vip.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/rec-solar_press_dhx-microgrid_02.jpg"" alt=""DHX solar microgrid"" width=""900"" height=""583"" />

The solar generation is combined with 222 kWh of battery energy storage, a microgrid controller and other equipment. The result is a zero-emissions energy system that protects DHX’s sensitive electronic equipment and provides up to four hours of backup power during outages. The microgrid enables a graceful shutdown and smooth transition from grid power during electric outages.

“Avoiding costs from damaged computers, servers and other equipment could in itself pay for the system,” Dechter noted. “And using the energy we produce on-site is a great way to shift load, reduce my peak usage and lower year-round demand charges. That cuts costs year-round.""

“I like the package REC put together as it allows us flexibility and coverage we need at the best value,” added Dechter. “And the solar panels on the roof spell out DHX – a great way to promote our business to those traveling by plane or helicopter over the shipping and warehouse districts.”
<h4>Phase 2</h4>
With the first phase of the project completed, the next phase includes the installation of more solar on the alternate side of the roof. The additional clean energy will provide electric vehicle charging capacity for the company’s planned transition to electric vehicles (EV) in the future.

That’s even more carbon reduction to make Dechter’s granddaughter proud.

<h6>Pleasanton Unified School District is the latest education sector customer to work with REC Solar to deploy onsite solar plus storage solutions</h6>
<h6>Installation illustrates Education market need to control peak demand and lower costs that is spurring 13 fold growth of energy storage market overall</h6>
REC Solar, a subsidiary of Duke Energy Renewables, which is a commercial business unit of Duke Energy (NYSE: DUK), has partnered with Pleasanton Unified School District (PUSD) in Pleasanton, California to utilize solar plus  energy storage solutions that cut emissions and energy costs.

Pleasanton Unified, which is a public primary and secondary education school district located east of San Francisco, is the latest installation at more than 100 districts and schools where REC Solar has implemented clean energy generation and storage solutions.

“Pleasanton Unified is a great example of US education market’s increasing desire to tap on-site solar generation combined with energy storage,” said Matt Walz, CEO REC Solar.“By choosing solar plus storage, the district will further control costs under new Time of Use rates, reduce demand charges and cut emissions during peak hours when the electric grid is stressed by high demand.”

REC Solar will install 1 megawatt (MW) of solar carports and a 660 kilowatt-hour (kWh) battery energy storage system at Pleasanton Unified’s Amador Valley High School..  The investment is projected to save the district more than $2.2 million over the 25-year lifetime of the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), which will be financed by Duke Energy Renewables.

According to Wood Mackenzie Power &amp; Renewables, a leading energy research and consultancy firm, PUSD is an example of why education is one of the sectors driving 13-fold growth in energy storage globally by 2024.

“Education services is the largest subsegment of C&amp;I customers today,” said Brett Simon senior storage analyst at Wood Mackenzie Power &amp; Renewables. “School boards and universities make ideal customers for storage developers: They are willing to accept longer payback periods compared to private-sector customers, have multiple buildings to allow for many deployments from a single contract, and usually have needs for bill reduction and resilience.”

""For many years it has been our goal to educate global citizens while focusing on projects that improve health and well-being of our students, staff and community,” said David Haglund, Ed.D and PUSD Superintendent.  “As cutting emissions is crucial to our global future, our project to install solar generation plus battery storage will benefit our students for decades.”

PUSD is also re-configuring the parking lot at the school to maximize performance of the solar arrays while also enhancing the lot’s accessibility and safety features.  The new solar arrays will provide up to 97 percent of the high school’s current energy use and greenhouse gas emissions elimination. Students will also have access to REC Solar’s GreenPowerMonitor tool and data for hands-on learning opportunities.

<a href=""https://recsolar.com/"">REC Solar</a>, a national provider of commercial solar and energy solutions, today announced the interconnection of a 1 MW solar energy system for <a href=""https://www.windsetfarms.com/"">Windset Farms®</a>. The Santa Barbara County farm is the largest in Santa Maria and grows non-GMO produce year-round in its state-of-the-art greenhouse facility. The roof-mounted array will enable the farm to run on clean energy, further enhancing its sustainable operations. This installation adds to REC Solar’s portfolio of over three dozen farms and food and beverage facilities in California.

“REC Solar is the clear leader in helping California farms go solar, and deciding to work with them was an easy decision,” said David Wesley, Director of Projects at Windset Farms®. “They helped us overcome some unique construction challenges, like high winds and site access restrictions. To top it off, the system was easy to finance and helped us save money on our energy bills immediately.”

REC Solar installed the 4,032-panel array on the roof of the farm’s shipping and packing building. The system was designed to accelerate the farm’s return on investment by maximizing energy production and offsetting consumption when utility electricity rates are highest. To achieve this goal, REC Solar installed a custom racking system combining flush-mounted panels on the western roof face and southern-tilted panels on the eastern roof face to receive optimal sun exposure. The racking system does not penetrate the roof, which will minimize long-term maintenance costs.

“REC makes it easy for farms to go solar because we cater to their specific business operations and ensure minimal disruptions.

Windset Farms® is a leader in deploying cutting-edge sustainable technology, including but not limited to water and CO2 recycling, an Integrated Pest Management system, heat-loss prevention screens and efficient land use. The family-run 128-acre facility in Santa Maria grows many varieties of tomatoes and cucumbers for leading national retailers.

The farm will host a ribbon cutting ceremony for their new solar installation on Tuesday, August 18 at 2 p.m.
